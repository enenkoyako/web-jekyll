&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In democracies around the world, billions of citizens have countless interests, opinions, and positions that have never been spoken. The actual state of politics is much more complicated than what the current political symbols and categories allow us to express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our political choices are artificially limited by the abstract concept. These abstract concepts are not to simplify us into two opposing parties, or in the case of proportional representation, to several smaller parties. But either way, it suppresses the complexity of people’s true opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of overlapping interest groups in the world, not just two parties. There are also thousands of issues and sub-topics, not just a few topics that the media has paid attention to during the election period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elections and referendums severely limit the amount of information people can send to managing political parties. For example, the current method of compressing the will of the masses into a partisan platform has made 42% of Americans now recognized as non-partisan, and their voices are excluded from the policy-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures in the UK are roughly the same, especially after Brexit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/new-centrist-party-politically-homeless-brexit-labour-conservative-poll-a8312991.html&quot;&gt;Independent Report&lt;/a&gt; shows, “ Millions of voters feel politically homeless and consider supporting a new middle party… Nearly half of the respondents said they believe that no established party can act as their representative, and that the new organization will have the opportunity to win them. Vote.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:/ /www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a participant in democracy, the world we see, It is largely influenced by the “public opinion representatives allow us to see what”. A political party is like a very low-resolution photo that blurs out the important aspects of what voters really want and want to accept. To make matters worse, the partisan platform abandons the issue of consensus and instead prefers the issue of differentiation that is more useful for gaining power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Brexit referendum, including thousands of topics in a dual vote, leaving only the “left” or “left” perspective, this is the epitome of politics. This scourge of polarization and stalemate in modern politics is the result of our oversimplification of the way citizens participate, not our constitution, government structure or demographic characteristics. We live in a political two-dimensional world because we think about the tools and classifications of ourselves and others, all superficial and without depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of the citizenship, how can we make our political space more meaningful, and let our society as a whole have more dimensions and more detailed resolution? To answer this question, we need to find alternatives to citizen participation, not just a few key votes – such as a presidential election or a referendum like Brexit – to solve all issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office of the President’s Letter of the Obama Administration, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/what-americans-wrote-to-obama.html&quot;&gt;Let’s see&lt;/a&gt; A source and process of direct public opinion. During his tenure at Obama, the White House received about 10,000 letters a day from the people. The letters were read by a group of 300 volunteers and several full-time staff members, and finally the president selected 10 letters a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 10 letters can be regarded as the “best compromise”, which broadly represents people’s thoughts and feelings, and also recognizes the fact that the president cannot read and digest all the masses of letters. This is the original material that writes the people’s words in their own words, inputs the artificial processing program with special empathy and quality orientation, and uses the compression algorithm to process the results. This is a process of fundamentally respecting the voice of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this practice is not common. Recently, a major department of the US federal agency is facing a public comment period, with an estimated influx of nearly one million comments, but only one federal civil servant is responsible for reviewing the millions of comments. The same process goes through when dealing with the opinions of business lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we are living in an era of mass participation, everyone has a way to express their voices, but the government’s structure has not yet caught up. Today’s democracies have much room for improvement in the design of issues and the formulation of democratic policies. Therefore, during the election period, every issue has to face tremendous pressure when it comes to discussing space. It is conceivable that this process will make citizens feel dissatisfied and the government will not be able to obtain a clear public opinion authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need an extensible compression mechanism to gain a deeper understanding of the rich qualitative information provided by citizens. Can the process of the “Obama Letter Office” be further automated, expanded and improved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the topic of democratic governance needs special consideration, it is not a new issue for the information industry to deal with such large-scale input. For example, Netflix promotes product decisions through automated data collection and analysis: through the wide range of behavioral data of viewers, not only can other programs be recommended to viewers, but they can also be used to provide decision-making information for new programming. The results of this analysis overturned the traditional thinking of “what people would like to see” in the past, as Janko Roettgers wrote in 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2017/digital /news/netflix-lab-day-behind-the-scenes-1202011105/&quot;&gt;in Variety magazine&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Netflix used to recommend content based on the region in which its users are located. After all, it is generally believed that the preferences of South American users and Canadian users should be The difference. But after careful observation, the company realized that this was not the case.” Todd Yellin, vice president of Netflix products, said: “Every day we find that such stereotypes are becoming more and more unreasonable.” Instead, Netflix will now Users are divided into 1,300 taste communities, and the way they are grouped is based entirely on viewing behavior. Each user can belong to multiple communities, and the community members are all over the world. Of course, Yelling also admits that German comedians may be more popular in Germany, but there are also many users in the United States who turn to their programs. “The most important part of “personalization” is to look for a taste community on a global scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/ 2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/&quot;&gt;category established&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/how-netflix-swallowed-tv-industry.html&quot;&gt;really more favorable&lt;/a&gt;, no longer a superficial “flat country” (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e5%b9%b3%e9%9d%a2%e5%9c%8b) classified “comedy” or “drama”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Netflix divides the film into 76,000 categories, such as “The Horror of the 1980s”, “Mental Food Documentary” and “Competitive System Album”. Movies can also belong to multiple categories, just as viewers can belong to multiple taste communities. For Netflix, the goal is clear: more appropriate recommendations, and more views, means higher customer engagement and better retention. The more valuable the platform is, the more likely people are to recommend it, and new customers will naturally join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, coupled with generous profit motives, has created the most accurate depiction of the world’s film and television audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Netflix (and to the rest of us) can more accurately view the messages created by large groups, as well as more details and more detailed descriptions of people’s faces. Netflix can “see” the community’s more preferences because they provide a more detailed description of the more complex preferences than Pepsi. If Netflix presupposes that there are only a few categories—history, drama, horror, war, and sports—it will inevitably limit the clarity of the user. In addition, this also affects the user’s perception of their clarity and the language they can use to describe themselves. Imagine that if all the issues, even the issues that the government has not realized or are about to consider, all the complexities of public opinion can have the same level of detail and instant awareness, that would be a good thing. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, there is indeed a better way to present citizenship. Perhaps the significance of getting these methods into the policy-making process is to create better policy outcomes. Faced with the communication challenges inherent in the “Occupy Movement” and the “Arab Spring”, we have developed Polis, an open source data science platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/crowdsourcing-democracy-using-wikisurveys/&quot;&gt;provides a rough ethnography&lt;/a&gt;, showing people reaching a range of possibilities Areas of consensus and disagreement. The mathematical theory is roughly the same as the recommendation engine used by Spotify or Netflix, which is to find similarities, differences, and consensus among people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2016, I spoke at the “Citizens Science and Technology College” conference in Turin, Italy. At that time, the focus of Italy’s attention was the forthcoming constitutional referendum. The referendum will determine the fate of the power of the executive branch, as well as the presidential position of Renzi. When Renzi announced the referendum, he threatened to resign if he tried hard but could not gain centralized power (he lost and resigned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the request of the organizer, I conducted a mock review of the referendum in the private environment of 40 participants. Participants submitted comments on the referendum and they may agree or disagree with the comments submitted by other participants. Polis’ machine learning algorithm runs automatically when the participant expresses a position on the statement submitted by the peer and produces a matrix of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to see: change each column in the spreadsheet from “movie title” to “personal opinion”, then change each column from “audience” to “elector”, and finally put each cell from Change the “score” to “agree or not.” In this way, the algorithm can find out the participant’s opinion patterns and form a cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some obvious clusters of opinions have emerged – those who are in favor of Renzi’s centralization, and others who are opposed. However, a statement from a single participant was unanimously supported: “The referendum is not a substitute for the election.” Regardless of their position or professionalism, the participants agreed that Renzi “will resign if the referendum fails.” The threat of the referendum detracted from the effectiveness of the referendum, leading to unanimous opposition from all political opponents, regardless of their original position on the Constitution. At the same time, it is obvious in other statements that some of the opponents of Renzi are actually open to the constitution. From the perspective of the dual referendum, this should be an issue of absolute polarization. However, the masses actually have complex and subtle views, are willing to weigh the various claims, and are eager to challenge the current process of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we promote citizen participation around the world, we see the same mode of action again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of 2019, Polis has been adopted by many governments. In a compelling case in Taiwan, Polis plays the role of input data to assist &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b&quot;&gt;Special Uber&lt;/a&gt; rulemaking. it turns out that as long as the commonalities are visualized, it can overcome the long-term stalemate of highly polarized stakeholders on complex issues, such as taiwan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611816/the an example of -simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/&quot;&gt;alcohol online shopping&lt;/a&gt;. The Canadian federal government has also carried out a number of related activities, such as “The Future of the Canadian Visual Arts Market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently in Germany, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aufstehen.de/pol-is/&quot;&gt;more than 30,000 people&lt;/a&gt; On Polis, nearly 2 million votes were voted on statements submitted by hundreds of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Bowling Green, Kentucky, Columbia University hosted a pilot program that invited thousands of Americans living in the Purple Zone (about 2% of the city’s population) to participate. This experiment has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civic-assembly.org/bowling-green-report/&quot;&gt;written as a report&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/ 2018/12/political-polarization-bowling-green-study-kentucky-immigration.html&quot;&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt; and reported by &lt;a href=&quot;https://civichall.org/civicist/testing-tech-consensus-purple-town/&quot;&gt;civicist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Ministry of Environmental Protection is working with independent media to promote public participation with Polis; the Ministry of Culture of Singapore is also engaged in dialogue with thousands of young people. The New York City Veterans Service Department is discussing with the social workers on the front line about the traveller policy, inviting these colleagues to share their experiences in their own language and verify with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a sampling strategy, such as 10,000 to 20,000 people each time, such a dialogue can easily be extended to all democratic citizens, with voting rights. Citizen gatherings of more than 10,000 people who never “shut down” are also feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge we face is how to combine emerging computing methods with strong existing policy development processes. In addition, we must also jointly decide whether the model of public opinion is defined by open materials and verifiable public methods, or by proprietary proprietary methods that cannot be checked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a representative democracy, not every decision is included in public participation. But when the government opens up to citizens to seek legitimacy and gain wisdom from the people’s life experiences and preferences, democracy can indeed do better. The government can set major and minor issues and engage with the public. The government can also attract people in a rich and dynamic way to let citizens know how their voices are heard. The government can also invite citizens to participate in the agenda setting in the early stages of decision-making – when the number of issues that need to be resolved is greater than the number of pages in the regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a democratic society, the ability to coordinate large-scale complexities has prompted us to rethink the various assumptions of how to represent public opinion in the past. In the future, the democratic system must face more and more effective management and integration in the face of large-scale qualitative information proposed by the people to avoid the deadlock caused by extremes. The original design of the representative system was designed to prevent the government from being controlled by the faction. In the case of democracy being sent to the hands of the faction, as citizens, we should uphold the original intention of democracy and continue to design better systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、Colin Megill</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">As citizens, we should uphold the original intention of democracy and continue to design better systems.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a51ab24bd076a61d3d1b07f4ffda418bf88dc724.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Promoting U.S.-Taiwan Economic and Commercial Ties</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A2%9E%E9%80%B2%E5%8F%B0%E7%BE%8E%E7%B6%93%E8%B2%BF-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E6%97%81%E8%A7%80/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Promoting U.S.-Taiwan Economic and Commercial Ties" /><published>2019-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A2%9E%E9%80%B2%E5%8F%B0%E7%BE%8E%E7%B6%93%E8%B2%BF-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E6%97%81%E8%A7%80</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A2%9E%E9%80%B2%E5%8F%B0%E7%BE%8E%E7%B6%93%E8%B2%BF-%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AA%E6%98%AF%E6%97%81%E8%A7%80/">&lt;p&gt;🌐 Many think international relations is the sole domain of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But given the rise of public and digital diplomacy, as well as Taiwan’s unique international status, it should be seen as collaborative effort among the citizenry, public and private sectors. It is also the most effective way of finding new solutions and realizing common values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 In April, the American Institute in Taiwan, MOFA and my office (Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://talkto.ait.org.tw/&quot;&gt;AIT@40 Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt;. This series consists of discussions taking place in April, June, August and October on how to improve each of the four main pillars of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship: “Taiwan’s role in the global community,” “U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial relations,” “U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation” and “U.S.-Taiwan people-to-people ties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 This collaboration is the first time the U.S. has publicly gathered diplomatic suggestions over the internet. Equally significant, it explores ways of enriching public relations through collective wisdom to improve exchanges and tie-ups with a strategic ally on multifaceted topics. This new benchmark shows that U.S.-Taiwan relations are at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 Currently, the topic we are discussing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/8bscsvxb3z&quot;&gt;how to improve the U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial partnership&lt;/a&gt;. There is no question in my mind that the Digital Dialogues is the best platform to share ideas and opinions on key issues at the heart of this vital aspect of the bilateral relationship. These include mutually beneficial strategies for managing potentially detrimental trade wars, bilateral trade agreement talks and U.S. incentives for firms to relocate manufacturing bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔝 According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance, the U.S. is Taiwan’s only major export destination recording an increase in shipments during the first half of 2019. The 17.4 percent year-on-year rise is no mean feat given the instability of global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 At the Select USA Investment Summit held by the U.S. Department of Commerce in Washington last month, Taiwan’s delegation numbered more than 100. This was highest among all countries, indicating that many homegrown businesses are ahead of the curve and already moving to get a piece of potential-laden action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🗣 It comes as no surprise, then, that U.S.-Taiwan trade and related matters will dominate the open forum I am hosting in mid-August to discuss and provide feedback on resonating ideas from the Digital Dialogues. The participation of officials from the AIT, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and relevant local ministries is certain to offer fascinating insights on issues impacting the Taiwan-U.S. economic and commercial ties, as well as the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 I invite all and sundry to attend the event and help advance related participatory policymaking.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation released its 47-page report The Age of Interdependence on 10 June. This is a very short summary aimed to help time-poor readers understand the main points of the report. The full report of the UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation, The Age of digital interdependence, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/digitalcooperation-report-for-web.pdf&quot;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the report contextualises the reasons for the panel and its report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital technologies are changing and touching every part of our lives.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While digital technologies are improving our lives in many ways, they also pose significant risks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The panel was asked to look at ways digital technologies can help achieve the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Around half of the world’s population still do not have access to the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The speed of digital development is getting faster all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to act now to find better ways of managing digital governance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital governance can benefit from utilizing the best of both multilateral and multistakeholder processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;declaration-of-digital-interdependence&quot;&gt;Declaration of Digital Interdependence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report invites all stakeholders to commit to a Declaration of Digital Interdependence: Humanity is still in the foothills of the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peaks are yet uncharted, and their promise still untold. But the risks of losing our foothold are apparent: dangerous adventurism among states, exploitative behaviour by companies, regulation that stifles innovation and trade, and an unforgivable failure to realise vast potential for advancing human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we manage the opportunities and risks of rapid technological change will profoundly impact our future and the future of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that our aspirations and vulnerabilities are deeply interconnected and interdependent; that no one individual, institution, corporation or government alone can or should manage digital developments; and that it is essential that we work through our differences in order to shape our common digital future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We declare our commitment to building on our shared values and collaborating in new ways to realise a vision of humanity’s future in which affordable and accessible digital technologies are used to enable economic growth and social opportunity, lessen inequality, enhance peace and security, promote environmental sustainability, preserve human agency, advance human rights and meet human needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-digital-cooperation-architectures&quot;&gt;Possible digital cooperation architectures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel presents three possible architectures that could contribute to ongoing discussions on digital cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-internet-governance-forum-plus&quot;&gt;1. Internet Governance Forum Plus&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Would work on policies and norms of direct interest to stakeholder communities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To consist of: Advisory group, Cooperation accelerator, Policy incubator, Observatory, Help desk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To have a dedicated IGF Trust Fund.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-decentralized-co-governance-architecture-cogov&quot;&gt;2. Decentralized co-governance architecture (“COGOV”)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build on existing mechanisms and fill any gaps with new mechanisms using a self-forming ‘horizontal’ network approach (e.g. IETF, ICANN).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decouples the design of digital norms from their implementation and enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three functional elements: Digital cooperation networks, Network support platforms, Network of networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-digital-commons-framework&quot;&gt;3. Digital Commons Framework&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Governments, civil society and business to work together to ensure digital technologies promote the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi-stakeholder tracks would discuss emerging issues, then come together at an annual meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;underpinning-values&quot;&gt;Underpinning values&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel identified nine values that should shape the development of digital cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inclusive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human-centeredness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Human flourishing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transparency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sustainability&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harmony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Support full digital inclusion for women and marginalized groups; international institutions to focus on women and inclusive technology in research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop metrics on digital inclusiveness, including gender-disaggregated data, for worldwide use and reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Establishing regional and global digital help desks to help governments, civil society and the private sector understand digital issues and build capacity to steer their social and economic impacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UN Secretary-General to conduct a UN agencies-wide review of how existing international human rights accords and standards apply to digital technologies. All stakeholders should be encouraged to provide input.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social media companies to respond to concerns about existing or potential human rights violations around the world, in consultation with governments, civil society and human rights experts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engage multiple stakeholders to develop ethical standards for the design and application of accountable and non-biased AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UN Secretary-General to hold an open consultation process to create up-to-date mechanisms for global digital cooperation with three architecture options (described earlier in summary) as a starting point: Internet Governance Forum Plus, Distributed co-governance architecture, Digital commons architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May involve the appointment of a Technology Envoy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support a new, multi-stakeholder, “systems” approach for regulation that is adaptive, agile, inclusive and fit for purpose.&lt;/li&gt;

National skill champions and vocational education of all trades will be the highlight of the National Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👷 These are not my words, but those of Executive Yuan Youth Advisory Committee member and Skills for U CEO Huang Wei-xiang. They come from the first paragraph of a post on Facebook page Craftsmanship Insights, posted on June 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 Most readers would know Taiwan is an “invisible champion” in many fields, serving as the mainstay of various industries. Taiwan’s famous cuisine, in particular, has received worldwide praise these two years as Taiwanese restaurants gain a presence in the Michelin Guides. However, we should all acknowledge the soul behind Taiwan’s excellent products and services in multiple fields —  the veterans cultivated by vocational education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎉 In fact, Taiwan’s skill veterans have long been shining on the international stage. WorldSkills Competitions is a biennial event hosted by the 81 member states of WorldSkills International, and the competition is so fierce it is considered to be an Olympics of skills. In the 44th WSC of 2017, Taiwan won four gold medals, one silver medal, and 27 bronze medals, with a winning rate of 88%; in 2015, Taiwan won five gold medals, seven silver medals, and 19 bronze medals, ranking 3rd place overall. These results are no doubt first class in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 Regrettably, such excellent results were not well known in Taiwan. This has caused the disproportional resources allocation on the part of the government, as well as a misunderstanding of the Taiwanese on the strength of the country. Fortunately, Huang Wei-xiang’s proposal alongside with Executive Yuan President Su Tseng-chang’s prompt instructions, and Legislative Yuan President Su Jia-chyuan’s full support have allowed these veteran’s skills to come into light in the National Day celebrations this year, so that they can receive their deserved acknowledgment and acclaim from both nationals and foreign guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Today’s results are made possible by the Yuan-level Youth Advisory Committee, programmed and founded by Executive Yuan’s former Premier, Lin Chuan. They are also concrete proof to Lin’s original intention fulfilled: the members’ deep insights into public policies, active participation and suggestions have brought overall innovation to policy execution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Youth Engagement" /><summary type="html">The national team of the World Skills Competitions (WSC) will be part of this year's National Day Parade to receive everyone’s applause!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c9a67a08ad4ef90821636f4c30fea558d2880ada.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">“Quadratic Voting” and “Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax”</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%B9%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E6%B3%95-%E8%88%87-%E5%85%B1%E6%9C%89%E8%87%AA%E8%A9%95%E7%A8%85/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“Quadratic Voting” and “Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax”" /><published>2019-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E3%80%8C%E5%B9%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E6%B3%95%E3%80%8D%E8%88%87%E3%80%8C%E5%85%B1%E6%9C%89%E8%87%AA%E8%A9%95%E7%A8%85%E3%80%8D</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%B9%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E6%B3%95-%E8%88%87-%E5%85%B1%E6%9C%89%E8%87%AA%E8%A9%95%E7%A8%85/">&lt;p&gt;🗳 As I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/商周專欄-你來許願-全民-還願/&quot;&gt;mentioned earlier in this column&lt;/a&gt;, this year’s Presidential Hackathon has successfully adopted the newly invented quadratic voting (QV) system so that the voting results for proposals will be more in line with the needs of the people. Incidentally, the Colorado state legislature in the United States had also used QV to vote on their budget priorities. Taiwan and the US have achieved significant milestones in the establishment of a new form of democratic governance in administrative and representative politics respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎪 QV is part of the recent “radical” intellectual current. In 2018, the inventors of QV, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Glen Weyl and Eric Posner from the University of Chicago Law School co-authored the book “&lt;a href=&quot;http://radicalmarkets.com/&quot;&gt;Radical Markets&lt;/a&gt;.” In addition to the articulation of QV, the book offers five different proposals on how to change the way our societies are modeled. The book led to heated debates in academia and the community, and was featured by “The Economist” as one of the books of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📢 Glen Weyl and Eric Posner believe that with regard to public affairs, individuals tend to hold different opinions and are reluctant to share their private knowledge with others. If more people can be encouraged to share their genuine opinions through well-designed market mechanisms, the society can work collectively to find better solutions to existing problems. The QV system hinges on the idea that “a higher concentration of votes requires more points,” which encourages people to vote according to their true preferences instead of concealing their actual inclinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💰 Another novel concept in the book is the Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax (COST), which allows people to declare the price of their assets but for which they would have to pay an annual fixed tax. If a buyer offers to purchase the asset at the declared price, the owner of the asset cannot refuse to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛒 The idea behind COST originated from the fact that although a person’s appraisal of value may be subjective (especially for intangible assets), this “Harberger Tax” mechanism can still effectively discourage price gouging as well as promote transparency, increase liquidity, and prevent hoarding. Through market design, people can share their actual preferences and information with others, which is the origin of the radical market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌎 Glen Weyl and Vitalik Buterin (co-founder of Ethereum) launched the RadicalxChange (RxC) Foundation to advance these principles, and I was invited to work pro-bono as a board member along with the political philosopher Danielle Allen. In the past, civil servants were prohibited from holding concurrent appointments in foreign non-profit organizations, but after this restriction was lifted by the Ministry of Civil Service in October last year, all civil servants can now participate in international organizations in social innovation with the prior permission of the authorities. This was also a change that we had pushed for in the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 The evolution of social innovation is based on different intellectual trends. The theories and methods developed by these currents are an important means by which we can achieve our social mission. Starting from the accomplishments of QV in Taiwan and the US, I hope that my civil servant colleagues can be more active in international non-profit organizations in the future and imbibe prevailing intellectual currents more swiftly. These ideas can be applied to their official work and be a source of inspiration for social innovation in Taiwan, which will in turn be disseminated to the international community and contribute significantly to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Aafter this restriction was lifted by the Ministry of Civil Service in October last year, all civil servants can now participate in international organizations in social innovation with the prior permission of the authorities.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/0/06b90db7e18c8b1d288d2f565ae1141f14483a11.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Open Government meets Open Parliament</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E9%81%87%E4%B8%8A%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open Government meets Open Parliament" /><published>2019-06-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-06-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E9%81%87%E4%B8%8A%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E9%81%87%E4%B8%8A%E9%96%8B%E6%94%BE%E5%9C%8B%E6%9C%83/">&lt;p&gt;⚖️ On May 31st, my office (Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) was invited by MP Ch’iu Chih-wei to take part in the preparation and implementation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2677074105864517&amp;amp;id=1588286501409955&quot;&gt;Public Hearing&lt;/a&gt; on “Non-Disclosure of Information under Investigation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎙️ This is the first time that we have tried a new mode of cooperation with the Legislative branch, marking a new chapter in Taiwan’s progress of open government. On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude and affirmation of MP Ch’iu Chih-wei’s invitation and breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🆕 There are three main points of difference between this public hearing and those in the past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👂 First, we conducted a comprehensive series of pre-hearing interviews. Previously, organizers would invite as many stakeholders as possible to take part so that a diversity of opinions could be collected. However, an increase in the number of attendees and speakers often led to time restrictions on each speaker to express and exchange opinions at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💬 In view of this, the PDIS host team and the committee office conducted a total of 10 interviews prior to the meeting. Through a painstaking investigation of the “non-disclosure of information under investigation regime” and detailed records, we made sure that all participants have received the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mmEO8WPOzB8XDs4V0XMSmbO39I1ZkOZDTxks0J7cx-0/edit#heading=h.jgexw6fafmb&quot;&gt;stakeholders’ complete views and suggestions&lt;/a&gt; one week in advance. In other words, the synchronization and focus of opinions had already begun before the meeting officially started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📊 Second, like other major policy issues, the context of the “non-disclosure of information under investigation regime” is profound and far-reaching. In order to enable all participants as well as viewers watching the live webcast in real time to keep up with the rhythm of the discussion and not “lag behind” in the process, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kx42gKI=/&quot;&gt;Issue Mapping&lt;/a&gt; as an auxiliary tool on the hearing day. That is to say, using the charts, the non-disclosure of information under investigation regime was divided into several major programs, the implementation process and difficulties of each individual program was listed, and the causal relationship between them was linked in the correct order, so that everyone could just “click the map and follow the track” at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Third, the public hearing was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4laQWtbK4o&quot;&gt;livestreamed&lt;/a&gt; and open to online questions. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2019-05-31-%E8%90%BD%E5%AF%A6%E5%81%B5%E6%9F%A5%E4%B8%8D%E5%85%AC%E9%96%8B%E5%85%AC%E8%81%BD%E6%9C%83&quot;&gt;complete transcript&lt;/a&gt; was published on the PDIS website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://track.pdis.tw/&quot;&gt;track.pdis.tw&lt;/a&gt;) afterwards. The purpose of doing so was not only to have a complete record of the meeting but also to allow relevant discussions to continue beyond the meeting and to provide a reference guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚀 This successful endeavor paves the way to future cross-institutional collaborations. On the 31st, Executive Yuan member Ch’iu Chih-wei also said that he will be conducting another public hearing three months after the implementation of the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://mojlaw.moj.gov.tw/LawContent.aspx?LSID=FL068478&quot;&gt;Non-Disclosure of Information Under Investigation Act&lt;/a&gt;” on June 15th. We look forward to more Legislative public hearings and to further cooperations with MPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">This opportunity is not only the first time we have tried a new mode of cooperation with the legislators' office, but also a new chapter in the process of Taiwan's promotion of open government and the opening of the Congress.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/e/ec5471e279d887cd99eb619ea8960dca9790691f.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The changing and unchanging National Palace Museum</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%85%E5%AE%AE%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%8A%E8%88%87%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%8A/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The changing and unchanging National Palace Museum" /><published>2019-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%85%E5%AE%AE%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%8A%E8%88%87%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%8A</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%85%E5%AE%AE%E7%9A%84%E8%AE%8A%E8%88%87%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%8A/">&lt;p&gt;🏰 What crosses your mind when someone mentions the “National Palace Museum”? Is it its rich collection of treasures and solemn courtyards, or its status as an international museum with a long history that is still able to keep up with the times and dare to embrace the spirit of openness and collaboration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Since last month, my office (PDIS, the Executive Yuan’s Public Digital Innovation Space) has officially launched a collaborative program with the Forbidden City at the invitation of the National Palace Museum’s President, Wu Mi-cha. In the next few months, we will be assisting the National Palace Museum in redesigning programs such as automatic ticket purchases, online bookings and entry lines. Through processes such as interviews with multiple stakeholders; completely recorded collaborative discussions with users and full process preliminary testing and other procedures, the National Palace Museum will be offering visitors a convenient and comfortable ticket purchasing experience that is closer to their true feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📖 This represents another step forward by the National Palace Museum on its path of openness and collaboration. In July two years ago, under the impetus of former president Lin Cheng-i, the National Palace Museum opened more than 70,000 cultural relics in the form of open materials, so that any person could download and use them free of charge. Under the continuing efforts of the two succeeding presidents, Ch’en Ch’i-nan and Wu Mi-cha, the number of open materials has reached more than 100,000. Although the speed and quantity of the materials are still not as strong as the materials offered by the Metropolitan Museum of New York or the National Palace Museum of the Netherlands, the National Palace Museum is already at the forefront and has great symbolic significance compared to similar tier museums in Asia. In the near future, the National Palace Museum will continue to expand and deepen the quality of its open materials with the support of the forward-looking infrastructure budget. This is well worth everyone’s anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔮 Furthermore, the National Palace Museum has demonstrated ingenuity in its innovative use of new media. In February last year, I “inhabited” a free-moving robot that was equipped with a 360-degree panoramic lens. In my first visit to the Southern Court of the National Palace Museum, President Lin Cheng-i and hundreds of people were online at the same time, along with viewers who watched the video afterwards. Together, we viewed the “The Pinnacle of Japanese Art: Exhibit from the Collection of Tokyo/Kyushu National Museum” which was extremely rare to see in Taiwan. For me, this viewing experience that transcended temporal and spatial constraints definitely represented a new path to enable the National Palace Museum to improve publicity and establish new paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌈 The essence of the National Palace Museum lies in its steadfast preservation of its precious collection that captures fleeting beauties in moments of history; at the same time, how the Museum should adapt to the times so that more viewers can use multiple ways to gain access and understand the National Palace Museum represents not only an opportunity for us to grasp but also a responsibility for us to achieve change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In the next few months, we will be assisting the National Palace Museum in redesigning programs such as automatic ticket purchases, online bookings and entry lines.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/7/776a1eae5095de146f2e2547fd26e3122ad0b9c6.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">From ”warm power” to ”global impact”</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%BE%9E-%E6%9A%96%E5%AF%A6%E5%8A%9B-%E5%88%B0-%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From ”warm power” to ”global impact”" /><published>2019-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%BE%9E%E3%80%8C%E6%9A%96%E5%AF%A6%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%8D%E5%88%B0%E3%80%8C%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%8D</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%BE%9E-%E6%9A%96%E5%AF%A6%E5%8A%9B-%E5%88%B0-%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B/">&lt;p&gt;📈 In the business field, whether to invest in a product or service, the investment report rate (Return on Investment, ROI) is often an important reference. Through calculation of the financial formula, the balance of loss and benefit can be understood at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❓But this approach is difficult to apply directly to activities of public interest. For example, the three-wheeled cars I have introduced, or the “voting guide” website, these innovations result in the public interest which is often hard to represent as the number of input into the report formula. How can we prove that these achievements are effective? This is an important issue in the innovative field of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄With this increasing demand, many impact assessment methods have been born. For example, the Social Reporting Standard (SRS) set up by the European Union’s Social Reporting Initiative (SRI). Based on the IOOI (input / output / outcome / impact), it presents in its entirety the present organization, related activities, and the aftermath impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💵 The Social Return on Investment (SROI), like the investment rate, combines social benefit and the economic model. For example, the calculation result is $4.5, which means that for every $1 invested, you can create a social price value of $4.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💁These new evaluation methods, just as the rate of investment and reporting, present the public welfare production of the social association department. They let all those who put into action know how much practical benefit to society and the environment is generated by what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📐Many special cases in the public department will have an impact on society. Therefore, impact evaluation has also been widely valued by the government of various countries as a tool to help make decisions. As far as the “open government” is concerned, as a result of withholding the 16th goal of sustainable development of the United Nations, it has now become the principle of all countries in the world. Whether it is application of cross-departmental data, or coordination with the community of citizens, there is a great need for a global assessment, so that the community and the government can connect with each other and move forward successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌎I am now at the opening of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Summit in Canada. This year, Taiwan is not only invited to share the experience of “Presidential Hackathon,” but will also cooperate with the scientific and technological community of citizens and representatives of the governments of various countries to make a common endorsement and mutual reference to the evaluation model, so that the effectiveness of the opening will no longer be limited to the number of data sets, but will also measure the impact on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞There is one of the most active open communities in the world in Taiwan. Based on that, we will adopt the spirit of impact assessment. Through co-creation with citizens, we will condense it into an “Open Government National Action Plan” so that the world can see how the “warm power” of democracy in Taiwan can be transformed into “global impact” for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Through co-creation with citizens, we will condense it into an ”Open Government National Action Plan” so that the world can see how the ”warm power” of democracy in Taiwan can be transformed into ”global impact” for the whole world.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/32c68698d6b30829ea114ec939c478d0657b2ad2.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Village’s Journey to Sustainable Fashion</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%9D%91%E8%8E%8A%E7%9A%84%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E6%99%82%E5%B0%9A%E4%B9%8B%E6%97%85/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Village's Journey to Sustainable Fashion" /><published>2019-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%9D%91%E8%8E%8A%E7%9A%84%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E6%99%82%E5%B0%9A%E4%B9%8B%E6%97%85</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E6%9D%91%E8%8E%8A%E7%9A%84%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E6%99%82%E5%B0%9A%E4%B9%8B%E6%97%85/">&lt;p&gt;💎 Have you ever thought that jewelry we wear could be made from environmental waste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇮🇩 A little while ago, I heard about a very interesting project—the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issuu.com/sl_studio/docs/fashion_village_lab_roadmap&quot;&gt;Fashion Village Lab&lt;/a&gt; in Cigondewah, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 This year, in order to promote regional sustainable development, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is conducting the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://apses.asia/award/apply&quot;&gt;Asia-Pacific Social Innovation Cooperation Award&lt;/a&gt;. It has received entrants from as many as 13 countries, and ended up with 62 teams in total. The Fashion Village Lab is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏭 Indonesia is a garment manufacturing powerhouse. Bandung City accounts for 40% of the national garment output value. Bandung’s Cigondewah area is a distribution center for international brand manufacturers. Five years ago, the Bandung Creative Cities Forum (BCCF) and Dutch researchers established a presence there because the factory’s waste pollution was affecting the quality of life for local workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸After learning more about it, they combined local community strength to launch the Fashion Village Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;♻️The lab’s vision is to create a self-sufficient “circular creative ecosystem”: transforming solid pollutants produced in factories into products such as building blocks and jewelry; collaborating with students in architecture and design-related fields to build stores that showcase production processes, retain land for dyeing plants, develop new materials, and conduct experiments on sustainable textiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 The success of the Fashion Village Lab is based on an effective “3C formula”: connecting with local stakeholders (Connect), inviting everyone to collaborate (Collaborate), and finally incorporating businesses and stakeholders to expand innovative business models (Commerce). This formula is based on the field work of the Bandung Creative City Forum in the past ten years. It has successfully connected the stakeholders in production, government, study, research, and society, and has also made Bandung a member of the UNESCO “Creative City” network (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/bandung&quot;&gt;UCCN&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎁 Now that the Fashion Village Laboratory is in its final stages, and the Kawasan Wisata Sandang Cooperative, which is run by local women and youths, is ready to sell the finished products of the circular economy through the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 This year, Cigondewah’s team was unanimously recognized by a panel of experts from Japan, Singapore, Australia, Thailand, and India, and was awarded the “Special Jury Prize”. They will come to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apses.asia&quot;&gt;Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit&lt;/a&gt; in May this year to accept the award. Everyone is welcome to come to Kaohsiung to meet these excellent teams and explore new possibilities for regional revitalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">This year, Cigondewah's team was unanimously recognized by a panel of experts from Japan, Singapore, Australia, Thailand, and India, and was awarded the “Special Jury Prize”.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/7/718c3380c9efb619b63f7f850fb2a1ed368a5c81.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Keep moving up, gazing at the starry sky</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%8C%81%E7%BA%8C%E5%90%91%E4%B8%8A-%E4%BB%B0%E6%9C%9B%E6%98%9F%E7%A9%BA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Keep moving up, gazing at the starry sky" /><published>2019-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%8C%81%E7%BA%8C%E5%90%91%E4%B8%8A,%E4%BB%B0%E6%9C%9B%E6%98%9F%E7%A9%BA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%8C%81%E7%BA%8C%E5%90%91%E4%B8%8A-%E4%BB%B0%E6%9C%9B%E6%98%9F%E7%A9%BA/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For four million years, in the midst of the collision between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate, Taiwan has always been looking up and gazing at the stars -  this is going to continue into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌌 One month before I took office in 2016, I was fielding questions from different quarters on a Q&amp;amp;A platform. At the time, a reporter from Hong Kong’s TVB asked me: “What is your vision for Taiwan? When you think of “Taiwan”, how do you imagine her future is like?” This is the answer I gave at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⛰ The pushing motion of the earth’s plates has created a fault zone under the surface. This is the main reason that Taiwan has so many earthquakes. For me, the civilization living on this land has the same “fault”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇹🇼 In 1987, the government of the Republic of China lifted the martial law that had lasted for almost 40 years. “Authority” and “freedom”, the two major plates that had engaged in a long-term conflict, had finally shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🗽 In the thirty years since the lifting of the martial law, and despite the frequent conflicts between the generation accustomed to authority and the generation accustomed to freedom, the process of mutual integration and pushing has also created the most open and free civil society in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 Traditional dialogues about issues are mostly divided into a positive side and a negative side. It is easy for the discussions to become polarized or to lead to confrontation and mutual attack. In recent years, however, the assistance of digital tool has created multifaceted channels of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 Pol.is is one of the widely used tools. Every person can put forward ideas on the topic page and let other participants express their feelings about each other’s ideas with three options: “Agree”, “Disagree”, and “Skip”. The system follows the participants’ opinions and voting results and calculates the distance between the participants’ and other people’s positions. After that, it uses a visual method to express a spectrum that includes everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 In 2015, on the digital economic regulation adaptation platform (vTaiwan), the stakeholders discussed the policy direction of “diversified taxis” through Pol.is. This type of design went beyond the previous head-counting, win-or-lose methodology. Apart from making different opinions obvious at a glance, participants might also see that the people who disagree with them are also people whom they know, thereby recondensing the consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is bound to have a different answer to the question that the reporter asked me at the time. Currently, this approach gives us an opportunity to find out each other’s differences and common grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💬 Starting from the vTaiwan experience, the open source communities in Taiwan, Canada, Spain, Denmark, and Singapore have continued to improve Pol.is, strengthen the information security, implement EU privacy regulations, and add automatic translation capabilities. Since April this year, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Executive Yuan have cooperated to readjust the foundation of Pol.is and construct a “digital dialogue platform” ([talkto.ait.org.tw] (https:/ /talkto.ait.org.tw)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 This is also the first time that the US and Taiwan have opened up issues about which both sides are concerned and invited the public to join the discussion. I believe this will become a model for the future: enabling international cooperation is no longer just an agreement between governments; rather, it is also a synergy between the people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">This is also the first time that the US and Taiwan have opened up issues about which both sides are concerned and invited the public to join the discussion.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6e04f33dd4d43861d4f334783209baec38a555bc.jpeg" /></entry></feed>
