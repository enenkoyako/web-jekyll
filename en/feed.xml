As long as everyone is concerned about seeking consensus rather than differentiation, digital technology is still one of the best ways to increase participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 Taiwan has been committed to implementing this concept in recent years. Therefore, the government and the scientific and technological community have cooperated to establish an online platform and related digital measures to allow citizens to make recommendations for policy reform. Now, Taiwan is practicing democracy through “outsourcing” and building a more responsive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort to improve the transparency of the government stems from the moment when the Taiwanese people were angry with the government for lack of openness and political responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 18th, 2014, young social activists with hundreds of college students as the main body rushed into the Legislative Yuan to occupy the forum. Because the government was considering signing a “Service Agreement” with Beijing’s many doubts at the time, and on March 17, the ruling Kuomintang legislators announced the passage of the Service Agreement in just 30 seconds in the disputed standing committee. Let civil society be at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protesters’ appeal is to “reject the black box and return to the service” and ask the government to establish a more transparent bill review process. The 22-day occupation campaign ended after the government promised to strengthen legislative oversight of trade agreements. (The agreement has not been approved by the legislature so far.) However, the polls after the occupation showed that 76% of the people are still dissatisfied with the government, which shows the crisis of trust caused by the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;To compensate for this rift, the government at the time began to contact the citizen technology community g0v (zero-hour government), a group of civic-minded hackers who have been trying to improve government transparency through various open source initiatives. In the 318 campaign, g0v also actively participated in the occupation site to assist in the transparent convergence of information. The actions of these citizen hackers have drawn the attention of the government.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;In December 2014, Cai Yuling, then the Administrative Council Member of the Executive Yuan, proposed the hackathon of the government at g0v, hoping to establish a neutral third-party platform, so that the government can timely Various online community friends exchanged views and formed a consensus.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 A number of contributors from the g0v government at zero time collaborated with the Executive Yuan in 2015 on the vTaiwan platform. This community-run project aims to effectively bring together stakeholders from government, economic and social sectors to discuss policies related to the digital economy. Although the government has not responded to vTaiwan’s proposed obligations (this may change), the results of vTaiwan’s work can often be translated into specific government actions. Currently vTaiwan has processed 30 topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactive digital tool “Pol.is” is often used during vTaiwan’s discussion to ensure that policy discussions among multiple stakeholders are rational and consistent. With Pol.is, any vTaiwan participant can post comments about the policy topic being discussed. The important thing is that other users can’t respond directly to these comments, just click “Agree”, “Disagree” or “Skip/Unsure” on each comment instead of provoking and defamatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Pol.is analyzes these opinions through instant machine learning and produces an interactive chart that groups the same participants in the same block and separates them from other users with different ideas. . In this way, each participant can see their position on the spectrum of opinion and the gap with each group, and then start thinking about how to find the intersection of each other’s opinions. In an ideal situation, this will attract more people to express their opinions and join the discussion, creating a path for consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 vTaiwan is often used to solve some particularly difficult digital policy issues. For example, in 2015, Uber triggered strong opposition from taxi drivers who helped to resolve how Uber’s discussion was deadlocked; over the years, online wine sales have been deadlocked between companies and social groups, and in 2016, hundreds of people used it. The public of the platform proposed new regulations for online liquor sales within a few weeks; in 2018, vTaiwan assisted in the formulation of new regulations for the platform economy, as a platform for collecting opinions during the legislative process of the financial sandbox regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Taiwan has another citizen participation platform called Join. Compared to vTaiwan, the Join platform is fully maintained by the government and has a wider range of issues, such as empty house taxes and animal drug management. Compared to hundreds of thousands of people who have discussed issues on vTaiwan, Join’s website has had 10.6 million visitors since its launch in 2015—almost half of Taiwan’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 vTaiwan and Join have opened up a more direct communication channel between the Taiwanese government and citizens, and the government has benefited a lot. Because civil servants not only have access to new ideas and ways of thinking, but also the core of public service needs through the opinions of the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 The President’s Cup hackathon is another digital technology initiative. Since last year, the President has personally participated in this activity, gathering the public service department and citizen friends every year, working together in the hackathon to optimize and think of useful government services. The winning team won’t get the bonus, but the promise that the government will actually adopt these good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s President’s Cup hackathon, one of the five outstanding teams, is composed of civil servants and information specialists from the Information Division of the Court, proposing “referee reading” and “sentencing reference helper” Two ideas are designed to make the judicial system clearer and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, the issue of drinking and driving has received widespread attention. In recent years, the results of many drunk driving accidents have caused public opinion to boil. People often don’t understand why “just judge this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of public confusion, the court team developed a “sentencing information helper” to let the people Understand why the punishment for the same crime will be different. Take the example of “cannot drive safely” caused by drunk driving. They first find out more than 50,000 related referee books from the existing referee database, and then sort out the conditions for this crime, and then set these conditions on sentencing. Information system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Anyone who is curious about the judgment, as long as you enter relevant data such as “alcohol breath concentration” and “vehicle type” on this system, you can not only see the appropriate punishment for the case proposal, but also A similar case judgment can be seen. Such an approach would make the public more aware that a single change in alcohol concentration could lead to a very different judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 “Dare to do it, don’t be afraid to make mistakes.” In the closing speech of the President’s Cup hackathon this year, President Tsai Ing-wen encouraged civil servants with hacker spirit. In Taiwan, digital technology is actively promoting citizen dialogue and injecting a spirit of social innovation into the government. By “letting everyone speak”, Taiwan is strengthening democracy for the future of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、彭筱婷</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="開放政府" /><summary type="html">In Taiwan, an online platform based on artificial intelligence effectively prevents network whitening and gives citizens the opportunity to express their opinions.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan" /><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/">&lt;p&gt;🆕 I would like to share with you the good news: The 3rd Asia-Pacific Social Enterprise Summit will be held in Taoyuan in early May 2020. The organizer is Impact Hub Taipei, with authorization by the SME Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 The last two summits were held in Taichung and Kaohsiung respectively. Not only did they attract thousands of highly enthusiastic and experienced people from all over the world, but also through the continuous hosting of the summit, the summits gave participants from other countries the opportunity to learn about contributions from Taiwan. At the same time, the summits gave the domestic population with the same ambitions and hope to have a platform for communications and discussions, so as to solve specific social issues and to promote sustainable development through innovative business models and business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Of course, the most important aspect of hosting an international event is the local connections. In late September, MOEA colleagues and I, accompanying the organizers of the summit, met with Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan to seek administrative support from the city government. In addition to the promise of the Mayor Cheng regarding the support of the projects related to the venue of the summit, transportation connection, and enterprise connection, Mayor Cheng very efficiently formed an inter-departmental coordination group. He also introduced in detail the government’s assistance to the social enterprises, and suggested that the organizers could include more local elements of Taoyuan in the peripheral activities of the summit such as “social enterprise tours” and “social enterprise market.” It is worth expecting these elements in next year’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 Moreover, in order to promote the 17 sustainable development goals and implement the overall policy objectives of “friendly and kind, suitable to live and work,” Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the sustainable development goals in the region with actual data and cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 In fact, according to the statistics indicators of the counties and cities of the Ministry of the Interior in 2018, the total birth rate of Taoyuan City is not only the highest in the six municipalities, but also one of the highest in the country, second only to the Lianjiang County. In addition, Taoyuan is the city with the highest net migration rate in Taiwan and the highest rate of social increase. These figures not only represent the achievements of Taoyuan in recent years, but also the foundation for promoting social innovation in the future. We look forward to Taoyuan’s contributions as a demonstration for all counties and cities in Taiwan, so we can flourish together toward the goals of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、黃子維</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the SDGs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Safeguarding Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safeguarding Taiwan" /><published>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;🛡️ Taiwan is home to more than 23 million people. One point on which all agree is the importance of safeguarding national security. In the past, related policymaking was the exclusive domain of the government. Today, the people can help shape this critically important process by participating in the on-going &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The Digital Dialogues are part of the AIT@40 campaign launched by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Digital Innovation Space in an effort to help digitally democratize the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  They are, according to AIT, “the first of its kind anywhere in the world  – a public forum to discuss the results of an artificial intelligence-enabled digital dialogue between a foreign mission and a local community on how to tackle a pressing foreign policy challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 They comprise four online public consultations this year on Taiwan’s role in global society, April; U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial exchanges, June; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, August; and people-to-people ties, November.  As AIT Director Brent Christensen said, “AIT is interested in what you, the public, have to say on these matters.  We hope these dialogues will provide valuable insights that AIT can put into practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛩️ Those interested in learning more about why Taiwan is purchasing advanced weapons like the F-16 C/D Block 70 fighters and M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as the reasons for closer U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, must take part in any discussions on the bilateral security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important security ally and partner. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan vote of support. It states that the U.S. government should provide “defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.” This ensures the U.S. supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining robust self-defense capabilities while consolidating national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ Since 2008, the U.S. has sold defensive weapons worth more than US$24 billion to Taiwan—an amount underscoring the strength of two-way ties. In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔜 AIT has said the AIT@40 Digital Dialogues for 2019 are not the end of the road for this revolutionary participatory policymaking initiative. They intend to continue to engage in future digital dialogues on the U.S-Taiwan relationship, including for the drafting of the Talent Circulation Alliance White Paper, which will become part of AmCham’s influential annual White Paper. Keep a close eye on this potential-laden public-private partnership for the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the Digital Dialogues give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f7f00652cc6dbed3c8f0e473dc2791fcb8339a.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too" /><published>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/">&lt;p&gt;🎓 “Can private universities turn into a social innovation organizations?” A few days ago, Professor Richard Fang from the Culture University asked me this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Professor Fang asked this question because the Department of Commerce announced the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” in August this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Last year, the “Corporation Law” was amended to include the conditions for company establishment, and added “the company’s actions to promote public interest.” Social enterprises that take into account their social responsibility and market operations can register as a company and voluntarily expose the charter to solve the problem in the past that profit and mission are unable to balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ However, in the social enterprise ecosystem, organizations with various forms also hoping that each other’s missions and  results can be more clearly disclosed in public. Therefore, when the amendment to the “Company Law” was passed, the Legislature  attached a resolution requesting the government to discuss how to respond to the needs of these friends within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇪🇨 To this end, many friends are actively seeking methods and providing advice. In March, I met with William H. Clark, Jr., the main promoter of the Common Law Act in the United States. He shared the case of Ecuador and provided a reference for Taiwan: that is, first proposing administrative rules and experimenting for a while, then form a formal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The advantage of “administrative rules” is that organizers who are committed to social innovation can proactively expose their charters, missions, and public interest reports without penalties. Not only to protect the current legal mechanism, but also let relevant companies refer to the results during the trial, and then decide how to form the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, we wrote the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” as a pilot point. Any type of organization can be registered as a social creation organization. The purpose is to enable any friend who is interested in social innovation to find a partner by log into the platform and expand social innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏫  So, can private universities turn into social innovation organizations? My answer is: “Of course!” Private colleges and universities, as long as they are registered in the organization type under the “financial corporation”, they can be regarded as a “business oriented financial corporation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 Over the years, whether it is the Ministry of Education’s “U-start Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program” or the “University Social Responsibility Practice Program” (USR), the creativity and vitality demonstrated by the teachers and students have fully demonstrated the spirit of social innovation: “everyone’s business, everyone helps.” As a organizer, colleges and universities will also develop closer partnerships for the practice of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The registration for the Cultural University has just completed. I hope that in the future, both public and private higher education institutions will be able to log in together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://si.taiwan.gov.tw&quot;&gt;si.taiwan.gov.tw&lt;/a&gt; platform and become fellow organizations to empower social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, the development of Taiwan in the past several hundred years has left a lot of humanistic scenery in the mountains and forests. Under the multiplication of the advantages of climate, geography, and people, the mountains and forests of Taiwan have rich background and resources in all fields, such as hiking, rock climbing, stream tracing, camping, bird watching, teaching, and so on, which are waiting for the exploration and experience of the people from the country and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔓 Over a long period of time, due to safety control and other considerations, many mountains and forests in Taiwan have been blocked and restricted to varying degrees, which have prevented the mountain friends from access. However, under the guidance of Premier Su and the coordination of Minister Chang Ching-sen, the Executive Yuan has passed the mountain forest control measures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Agriculture Committee, and the Ministry of State Defense, hoping to drastically loosen the restrictions and provide more opportunities for people to get close to the mountains and forests on the premise of maintaining sustainable living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 At the same time, the government has also moved beyond the practice of acting blindly irrespective of reality when formulating mountain and forest policies. Instead of sitting in air conditioned rooms to think about mountain affairs, we opened up “mountain climbing activities management” in the “Talk” section of the public policy participation platform (Join.gov.tw) of the National Development Council. We would like to welcome all citizens to provide advice and criticism on mountain and forest policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📢 This year’s national discussions are divided into five major themes: “Opening forests,” “Information transparency,” “Facility services,” “Mountaineering education,” and “Responsibility commitment.” The content of the discussions are open to the public, from the conception before the mountaineering, the clarification of the responsibility, to the control loosening before accessing the mountain, the redesign of the application process , and to the mountain house construction and the establishment of additional communication base stations after entering the mountain, etc. It can be said to include various aspects of mountain activities, which is worth everyone’s wisdom together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 In just a few seconds, you can choose “yes” or “no” to express your position to others’ opinions on the mountain and forest policy. You are also welcome to further share your innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 After September 30, the relevant departments and councils will review all the messages one by one according to the scope of their responsibilities, and discuss how to adopt the  “Group-Informed Consensus.” In this way, the messages that resonate among the masses will become part of the mountain and forest policy of Taiwan for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Executive Yuan’s monthly participation officer meeting, the motion passed the ballot to become the subject of the 53rd Collaborative Meeting. On August 16th, the collaborative meeting was convened and livestreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The meeting produced several recommendations that was agreed upon on all sides during the meeting, that the organizers, namely the Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, must publicly respond on the online participation platform with the specific details of the selection situation before October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recommendations, all participating agencies had already achieved some considerable common understanding during the meeting, in regards to the clarification of the relevant legal aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Firstly, the agencies agreed that the «Draft Proposal for The Regulations Governing the Use and Management of Human Drugs on Dogs, Cats, and Non-economic Animals» does not contradict the «Pharmaceutical Affairs Law».&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation made that day by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine clearly stated, “The proposed Regulations were stipulated in accordance with Article Four, Paragraph Three of the «Animal Protection Law», which also include the regulations for selling and distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) also pointed out that: “In regards to the administrative scope of the use of human medication being used to treat animals, Paragraphs Two and Three of Article Four of the «Animal Protection Law» state that the Council of Agriculture’s administrative range already includes the distribution and selling of human medications for animal use. Therefore, regarding regulations for distribution and selling of such medications, we should prioritize the application of the «Animal Protection Law».”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💊 Second, the 597 types of pharmaceuticals that have been publicly announced which can currently be used for the treatment of animals, will not be affected by «Good Distribution Practice for Pharmaceuticals» (PIC/S GDP), ensuring their continued supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 21st, the TFDA sent an official notice to the guilds for pharmacists, pharmaceutical companies, and the pharmaceuticals marketing agents to explain that before the proposed Management Regulations come into effect, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of animal medical treatment, you can still currently obtain human medication for use in treating animals, with the assistance of veterinarians. This is in accordance with Article Two, Rule Four of the «Animal Protection Law», which sets the categories of human medications that can be used on animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the proposer, seconder, colleagues of related departments, representatives of the pharmacists and the veterinarians guilds, and interested parties such as experts and scholars, we have specially invited the administrator of the Facebook group “CrazyCat Club” and the Forum Moderator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/cat/&quot;&gt;/cat/ board&lt;/a&gt; on the PTT Bulletin Board System to attend and participate in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇰🇷 Finally, the time period of the collaborative meeting just happened to coincide with Korea Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) coming to Taiwan to shoot a special report on the subject of opening up government and social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, aside from the live Internet broadcast of the entire event, the open discussion period provided the EBS team with footage and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✨ The producer of the EBS team said to me many times that day: “This kind of scene, it’s beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌈 I sincerely hope that aside from sending back the information gained from the meetings to their own social groups, all of the participants can bring the feelings of that day into more of the follow-up discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8b31e4edccedc00fbee350ae02a52ffcf96fce55.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Crowdfunding an umbrella</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crowdfunding an umbrella" /><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/">&lt;p&gt;☔ As an island on the Pacific Ocean, torrential rain is a typical characteristic of the climate in Taiwan. Therefore, umbrellas have always been indispensable for the Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 Thirty years ago, constant need for umbrellas provided a golden cow for Taiwan. When the industry was most prosperous, there were more than 300 umbrella factories in Taiwan. At that time, on average, one in every 40 people in the world used an umbrella made in Taiwan, thus the region’s nickname “umbrella kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☂️ Today, Taiwan’s umbrellas have once again become the focus of the world. In July of this year, the “inverted umbrella” invented by the Taoyuan brand “Yexin,” raised nearly NT$ 20 million within 62 days, winning the 2019 German Red Point product awards. It will officially enter the largest international fund-raising platform, Kickstarter, in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 All that originated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-03-14-%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83-%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1-office-hour/%E6%9D%8E%E9%B3%B3%E7%8F%A0&quot;&gt;a visit in mid-March last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 During my regular Wednesday office hours, Ms. Li Fengzhu, the one in charge of Yexin, walked quickly into my office in the social center. As soon as she sat down, she started to tell the company’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚉 Li Shengqun, the founder of Yexin, Ms. Li’s younger brother, is an expert in making umbrellas. When he went to Japan on a business trip more than a decade ago, he was busy looking at people coming and going at the bus station in Tokyo. They were in a great bustle, taking down their umbrellas. He was thus inspired to develop a reverse umbrella which would allow the umbrella to be folded in the opposite direction to avoid getting people’s clothes wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👷 Mr. Li did not expect that even if he made a patent for it, he still could not stop the rampant problem of copycats. Besides hand-wringing, he chose to improve his product continuously. It took him ten years to successfully transform the long umbrella, which is hard to put in the car, into a short and instantly reversible version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤔 They asked: How can we introduce the new inverse umbrella into the market without being affected by copycats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📣 As to that, I suggested that they adopt crowdfunding to tell their own stories. That would not only establish their brand name before the launch of the product and avoid copycats, but also let investors understand the work schedule, and even provide all manner of advice, so that more people could identify with the concept of the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💯 After a year of preparation, Yexin officially launched a special campaign in April this year, targeting the raising of NT$150,000 in two months, which was accomplished within ten minutes. In the next two months, the company received a hundred times more funding than the original target, reaching nearly NT$20,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌎 “We must push the brands of Taiwan to all over the world,” Ms. Li told me during her third visit. They were greatly encouraged by the success of the fund-raising and made a firm decision for the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👪 Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again. I look forward to seeing more inventors in the future go global and bloom all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/32b9bd92946de460e0000084630bbda0f7d91a59.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mazu protecting you at home</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mazu protecting you at home" /><published>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/">&lt;p&gt;🏆 July 27th was the final selection day for the second Presidential Hackathon. Congratulations to “Rounding Team,” “Angels of the Aged,” “Judicial Yuan,” “Loan Alert” and “Gov Data Opener,” the five selected outstanding teams that were commended by President Tsai Ing-wen in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👸 As the first outstanding team to win the award, the core proposition of “Rounding Team” was “Mazu protecting you at home: Providing individuals and families who choose to stay at home for end-of-life care with a targeted end-of-life care knowledge platform that is easy to learn from, easy to locate, and offers care that reaches its target,” proposed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Collaboration partners include: Hyweb Technology, Corporate Synergy Development Center, National Yang-Ming University, and Liu Yen-ling Home-based Care Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏥 Based on verification with domestic and foreign literature, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have needs based on “two do’s and three don’ts”: to be independent, to be at home, not to suffer, not to prolong life in futility, and not to burden one’s family. However, in reality, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have passed away in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚑 Taking cancer, ranking top among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan, as an example, close to 50,000 people die of cancer every year, among whom 80% were in hospitals. Why is this? “Rounding Team” believes that there are currently three problems in home-based care that need to be resolved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😯 First, the patient and their family members are “uninformed” what changes may occur and what preparations need to be made;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😵 Second, people feel “uneasy” about the quality of home-based care and whether resources available in the neighborhood and community are adequate;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🤔 Third, “unexpected” symptoms may develop, resulting in being ill-prepared in responding to emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 In spite of the mounting problems, the team nonetheless successfully demonstrated the possibility for change. Put simply, through data integration and technology application, “Rounding Team” is transforming the exemplary experiences of end-of-life care in Taiwan that rank among the top in the world into a “smart mobile care support platform” that patients and their family members can use at home through mobile phones or computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖧 For patients, they can gain an understanding of developments in their condition in advance and learn the skills of self-care they need to prepare, such as steps to alleviate pain. For family members, they can gain access to diverse sources of information and obtain support services through a single channel. Also, family members who live away from the patients can also gain up-to-date information on the physical changes in the patient through real-time data and image updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 Of course, the essence of end-of-life care ultimately lies in the people. However powerful the functions of medical knowledge platforms, they cannot operate if they are detached from mutual trust between care providers and patients, or face resistance from the patient or their family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡Thus, on top of continuing to develop the smart care platforms and specialist artificial intelligence systems proposed by “Rounding Team,” the Ministry of Health and Welfare has also promised to strengthen social dialogue, popularize care knowledge, and achieve the goal of “fully preparing for peaceful end-of-life care and zero gaps in home-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;

Based on statistics from the National Police Agency, in the last five years, there were more than 50,000 cases of “prosecution due to drink driving” in a year on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚔 Drink driving is one of the social issues that many people are concerned about. Recently, the government has amended regulations and increased penalties because of this. However, whenever the outcome of a court decision for a major drink driving case is released, doubts continue to be raised among public opinion: why “only a light penalty”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💁 This thorny issue has seen new breakthroughs recently. During the Presidential Hackathon this year, the Judicial Yuan team comprising legal and data experts proposed two ideas of “real-time reference” and the “sentencing reference aid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔧 In the last two years, the Judician Yuan has successively developed several tools, the “dictionary of difficult terms” and “dictionary of sentencing terms” to allow the public to look up professional legal terms and search for court verdicts through the “court verdict query system.” However, it is not possible to cross-reference using these tools, which instead led to difficulties for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 The Judicial Yuan team was inspired by the design of the Wikipedia interface and connected these tools to develop the “real-time reference” browser plug-in. When looking up court verdicts in the future, all you need to do is hover the mouse cursor over the term to see the corresponding explanation, allowing people who may be interested to quickly understand the contents of the court verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖥  The “sentencing information aid,” on the other hand, applies machine learning. Taking the “Offense of Unsafe to Drive” caused by drink driving as an example, they would first locate about 50,000 related court verdicts from the existing court verdict database, sort the factors involved in these offenses, and set up these factors on the sentencing information system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Anyone who is curious about the verdict only has to input different factors such as “breath alcohol content” or “vehicle type” to not only find the scope of proposed penalties, but also see the verdicts of similar cases. This way, everyone will be able to see that the same offense may result in very different sentencing outcomes, even if they only differ in one of the factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖ The Judicial Yuan team was eventually selected as one of the five outstanding teams of the Presidential Hackathon. Through them, we have seen not only the immense potential of “machine learning,” but also the innovative power brought about by “joint learning.” We look forward to future achievements of the team in resolving more doubts raised in society and putting into practice the cause of “judicial reforms that give people a sense of change” so emphasized by President Tsai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙏 Lastly, I am especially grateful to our colleagues from the Board of Science and Technology, National Development Council, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Institute for Information Industry for their assistance. It is thanks to their hard work over the last few months that the Presidential Hackathon was completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

The collaborative meeting was held on July 19th. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/348212d3-179e-4789-9e1e-ff2bcf4c00c8&quot;&gt;public response&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be made on the website after being jointly confirmed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤔 What can be shared in advance is the following: in the preparation process for the collaborative meeting, by interviewing stakeholders and analyzing statistical data, my office (Executive Yuan Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) found that to explore the feasibility of “vacancy tax”, there are at least three questions below that must be clarified first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚡ Firstly, there is no obvious direct correlation between the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” ratio in each city and county and the housing prices. “Low utilization (electricity usage) residence” statistics are derived by comparing and filtering the taxation data and Taipower electricity usage data each year, as done by the Ministry of the Interior’s Construction Department. According to the latest statistics, in November and December 2017, there were nearly 865,000 “low utilization (electricity usage” residences” in the country, or 10.12% of houses in the country. In 2009, this ratio was 11.49%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔎 To match the same time period, PDIS obtained the “housing affordability index” statistics from the Ministry of the Interior for the fourth quarter of 2017. We found that for the quarter, the six cities or counties with the highest “housing price to income ratio” are Taipei City (14.99 times), New Taipei City (12.71 times), Taichung City (9.61 times), Changhua County (8.79 times), Hsinchu County (8.62 times), and Kaohsiung City (8.22 times). Over the same period, the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” ratio for these six cities and counties are 6.73%, 7.65%, 9.66%, 11.78%, 11.13%, and 10.53%, respectively. This indicates that any correlation between “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” and housing prices is yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏚 Secondly, there are many causes for “low utilization (electricity usage) residences.” It is difficult to generalize. From the point of view of regional statistics, it may be that the population is moving out, or it may be the accumulation of unsold surplus houses. Furthermore, in addition to being own by investors and not yet rented or sold, a house may also be under-utilized due to other factors such as its remote location, a complication in its right of ownership, or its owner’s unwillingness to manage. In short, the multi-dimensional nature behind the phenomenon of “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚰 Thirdly, PDIS and the organizers chose to use the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” statistics as the basis of this collaborative meeting. However, after the discussion on the same day, we also found that by incorporating water usage data and field survey, we can provide the local governments a more accurate view of the quantity, type, and distribution of “vacant houses” in their respective jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📂 Proposals at join.gov.tw website often involve social phenomena at multiple levels. Through this collaborative meeting, we hope to clarify the factual contexts to the best of our ability, so that future discussions can be more focused and traceable.
