The organizer is Impact Hub Taipei, with authorization by the SME Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 The last two summits were held in Taichung and Kaohsiung respectively. Not only did they attract thousands of highly enthusiastic and experienced people from all over the world, but also through the continuous hosting of the summit, the summits gave participants from other countries the opportunity to learn about contributions from Taiwan. At the same time, the summits gave the domestic population with the same ambitions and hope to have a platform for communications and discussions, so as to solve specific social issues and to promote sustainable development through innovative business models and business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Of course, the most important aspect of hosting an international event is the local connections. In late September, MOEA colleagues and I, accompanying the organizers of the summit, met with Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan to seek administrative support from the city government. In addition to the promise of the Mayor Cheng regarding the support of the projects related to the venue of the summit, transportation connection, and enterprise connection, Mayor Cheng very efficiently formed an inter-departmental coordination group. He also introduced in detail the government’s assistance to the social enterprises, and suggested that the organizers could include more local elements of Taoyuan in the peripheral activities of the summit such as “social enterprise tours” and “social enterprise market.” It is worth expecting these elements in next year’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 Moreover, in order to promote the 17 sustainable development goals and implement the overall policy objectives of “friendly and kind, suitable to live and work,” Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the sustainable development goals in the region with actual data and cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 In fact, according to the statistics indicators of the counties and cities of the Ministry of the Interior in 2018, the total birth rate of Taoyuan City is not only the highest in the six municipalities, but also one of the highest in the country, second only to the Lianjiang County. In addition, Taoyuan is the city with the highest net migration rate in Taiwan and the highest rate of social increase. These figures not only represent the achievements of Taoyuan in recent years, but also the foundation for promoting social innovation in the future. We look forward to Taoyuan’s contributions as a demonstration for all counties and cities in Taiwan, so we can flourish together toward the goals of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、黃子維</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the SDGs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Safeguarding Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safeguarding Taiwan" /><published>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;🛡️ Taiwan is home to more than 23 million people. One point on which all agree is the importance of safeguarding national security. In the past, related policymaking was the exclusive domain of the government. Today, the people can help shape this critically important process by participating in the on-going &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The Digital Dialogues are part of the AIT@40 campaign launched by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Digital Innovation Space in an effort to help digitally democratize the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  They are, according to AIT, “the first of its kind anywhere in the world  – a public forum to discuss the results of an artificial intelligence-enabled digital dialogue between a foreign mission and a local community on how to tackle a pressing foreign policy challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 They comprise four online public consultations this year on Taiwan’s role in global society, April; U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial exchanges, June; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, August; and people-to-people ties, November.  As AIT Director Brent Christensen said, “AIT is interested in what you, the public, have to say on these matters.  We hope these dialogues will provide valuable insights that AIT can put into practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛩️ Those interested in learning more about why Taiwan is purchasing advanced weapons like the F-16 C/D Block 70 fighters and M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as the reasons for closer U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, must take part in any discussions on the bilateral security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important security ally and partner. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan vote of support. It states that the U.S. government should provide “defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.” This ensures the U.S. supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining robust self-defense capabilities while consolidating national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ Since 2008, the U.S. has sold defensive weapons worth more than US$24 billion to Taiwan—an amount underscoring the strength of two-way ties. In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔜 AIT has said the AIT@40 Digital Dialogues for 2019 are not the end of the road for this revolutionary participatory policymaking initiative. They intend to continue to engage in future digital dialogues on the U.S-Taiwan relationship, including for the drafting of the Talent Circulation Alliance White Paper, which will become part of AmCham’s influential annual White Paper. Keep a close eye on this potential-laden public-private partnership for the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the Digital Dialogues give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f7f00652cc6dbed3c8f0e473dc2791fcb8339a.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too" /><published>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/">&lt;p&gt;🎓 “Can private universities turn into a social innovation organizations?” A few days ago, Professor Richard Fang from the Culture University asked me this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Professor Fang asked this question because the Department of Commerce announced the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” in August this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Last year, the “Corporation Law” was amended to include the conditions for company establishment, and added “the company’s actions to promote public interest.” Social enterprises that take into account their social responsibility and market operations can register as a company and voluntarily expose the charter to solve the problem in the past that profit and mission are unable to balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ However, in the social enterprise ecosystem, organizations with various forms also hoping that each other’s missions and  results can be more clearly disclosed in public. Therefore, when the amendment to the “Company Law” was passed, the Legislature  attached a resolution requesting the government to discuss how to respond to the needs of these friends within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇪🇨 To this end, many friends are actively seeking methods and providing advice. In March, I met with William H. Clark, Jr., the main promoter of the Common Law Act in the United States. He shared the case of Ecuador and provided a reference for Taiwan: that is, first proposing administrative rules and experimenting for a while, then form a formal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The advantage of “administrative rules” is that organizers who are committed to social innovation can proactively expose their charters, missions, and public interest reports without penalties. Not only to protect the current legal mechanism, but also let relevant companies refer to the results during the trial, and then decide how to form the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, we wrote the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” as a pilot point. Any type of organization can be registered as a social creation organization. The purpose is to enable any friend who is interested in social innovation to find a partner by log into the platform and expand social innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏫  So, can private universities turn into social innovation organizations? My answer is: “Of course!” Private colleges and universities, as long as they are registered in the organization type under the “financial corporation”, they can be regarded as a “business oriented financial corporation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 Over the years, whether it is the Ministry of Education’s “U-start Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program” or the “University Social Responsibility Practice Program” (USR), the creativity and vitality demonstrated by the teachers and students have fully demonstrated the spirit of social innovation: “everyone’s business, everyone helps.” As a organizer, colleges and universities will also develop closer partnerships for the practice of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The registration for the Cultural University has just completed. I hope that in the future, both public and private higher education institutions will be able to log in together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://si.taiwan.gov.tw&quot;&gt;si.taiwan.gov.tw&lt;/a&gt; platform and become fellow organizations to empower social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, the development of Taiwan in the past several hundred years has left a lot of humanistic scenery in the mountains and forests. Under the multiplication of the advantages of climate, geography, and people, the mountains and forests of Taiwan have rich background and resources in all fields, such as hiking, rock climbing, stream tracing, camping, bird watching, teaching, and so on, which are waiting for the exploration and experience of the people from the country and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔓 Over a long period of time, due to safety control and other considerations, many mountains and forests in Taiwan have been blocked and restricted to varying degrees, which have prevented the mountain friends from access. However, under the guidance of Premier Su and the coordination of Minister Chang Ching-sen, the Executive Yuan has passed the mountain forest control measures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Agriculture Committee, and the Ministry of State Defense, hoping to drastically loosen the restrictions and provide more opportunities for people to get close to the mountains and forests on the premise of maintaining sustainable living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 At the same time, the government has also moved beyond the practice of acting blindly irrespective of reality when formulating mountain and forest policies. Instead of sitting in air conditioned rooms to think about mountain affairs, we opened up “mountain climbing activities management” in the “Talk” section of the public policy participation platform (Join.gov.tw) of the National Development Council. We would like to welcome all citizens to provide advice and criticism on mountain and forest policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📢 This year’s national discussions are divided into five major themes: “Opening forests,” “Information transparency,” “Facility services,” “Mountaineering education,” and “Responsibility commitment.” The content of the discussions are open to the public, from the conception before the mountaineering, the clarification of the responsibility, to the control loosening before accessing the mountain, the redesign of the application process , and to the mountain house construction and the establishment of additional communication base stations after entering the mountain, etc. It can be said to include various aspects of mountain activities, which is worth everyone’s wisdom together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 In just a few seconds, you can choose “yes” or “no” to express your position to others’ opinions on the mountain and forest policy. You are also welcome to further share your innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 After September 30, the relevant departments and councils will review all the messages one by one according to the scope of their responsibilities, and discuss how to adopt the  “Group-Informed Consensus.” In this way, the messages that resonate among the masses will become part of the mountain and forest policy of Taiwan for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Executive Yuan’s monthly participation officer meeting, the motion passed the ballot to become the subject of the 53rd Collaborative Meeting. On August 16th, the collaborative meeting was convened and livestreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The meeting produced several recommendations that was agreed upon on all sides during the meeting, that the organizers, namely the Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, must publicly respond on the online participation platform with the specific details of the selection situation before October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recommendations, all participating agencies had already achieved some considerable common understanding during the meeting, in regards to the clarification of the relevant legal aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Firstly, the agencies agreed that the «Draft Proposal for The Regulations Governing the Use and Management of Human Drugs on Dogs, Cats, and Non-economic Animals» does not contradict the «Pharmaceutical Affairs Law».&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation made that day by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine clearly stated, “The proposed Regulations were stipulated in accordance with Article Four, Paragraph Three of the «Animal Protection Law», which also include the regulations for selling and distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) also pointed out that: “In regards to the administrative scope of the use of human medication being used to treat animals, Paragraphs Two and Three of Article Four of the «Animal Protection Law» state that the Council of Agriculture’s administrative range already includes the distribution and selling of human medications for animal use. Therefore, regarding regulations for distribution and selling of such medications, we should prioritize the application of the «Animal Protection Law».”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💊 Second, the 597 types of pharmaceuticals that have been publicly announced which can currently be used for the treatment of animals, will not be affected by «Good Distribution Practice for Pharmaceuticals» (PIC/S GDP), ensuring their continued supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 21st, the TFDA sent an official notice to the guilds for pharmacists, pharmaceutical companies, and the pharmaceuticals marketing agents to explain that before the proposed Management Regulations come into effect, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of animal medical treatment, you can still currently obtain human medication for use in treating animals, with the assistance of veterinarians. This is in accordance with Article Two, Rule Four of the «Animal Protection Law», which sets the categories of human medications that can be used on animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the proposer, seconder, colleagues of related departments, representatives of the pharmacists and the veterinarians guilds, and interested parties such as experts and scholars, we have specially invited the administrator of the Facebook group “CrazyCat Club” and the Forum Moderator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/cat/&quot;&gt;/cat/ board&lt;/a&gt; on the PTT Bulletin Board System to attend and participate in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇰🇷 Finally, the time period of the collaborative meeting just happened to coincide with Korea Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) coming to Taiwan to shoot a special report on the subject of opening up government and social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, aside from the live Internet broadcast of the entire event, the open discussion period provided the EBS team with footage and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✨ The producer of the EBS team said to me many times that day: “This kind of scene, it’s beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌈 I sincerely hope that aside from sending back the information gained from the meetings to their own social groups, all of the participants can bring the feelings of that day into more of the follow-up discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8b31e4edccedc00fbee350ae02a52ffcf96fce55.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Crowdfunding an umbrella</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crowdfunding an umbrella" /><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/">&lt;p&gt;☔ As an island on the Pacific Ocean, torrential rain is a typical characteristic of the climate in Taiwan. Therefore, umbrellas have always been indispensable for the Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 Thirty years ago, constant need for umbrellas provided a golden cow for Taiwan. When the industry was most prosperous, there were more than 300 umbrella factories in Taiwan. At that time, on average, one in every 40 people in the world used an umbrella made in Taiwan, thus the region’s nickname “umbrella kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☂️ Today, Taiwan’s umbrellas have once again become the focus of the world. In July of this year, the “inverted umbrella” invented by the Taoyuan brand “Yexin,” raised nearly NT$ 20 million within 62 days, winning the 2019 German Red Point product awards. It will officially enter the largest international fund-raising platform, Kickstarter, in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 All that originated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-03-14-%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83-%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1-office-hour/%E6%9D%8E%E9%B3%B3%E7%8F%A0&quot;&gt;a visit in mid-March last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 During my regular Wednesday office hours, Ms. Li Fengzhu, the one in charge of Yexin, walked quickly into my office in the social center. As soon as she sat down, she started to tell the company’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚉 Li Shengqun, the founder of Yexin, Ms. Li’s younger brother, is an expert in making umbrellas. When he went to Japan on a business trip more than a decade ago, he was busy looking at people coming and going at the bus station in Tokyo. They were in a great bustle, taking down their umbrellas. He was thus inspired to develop a reverse umbrella which would allow the umbrella to be folded in the opposite direction to avoid getting people’s clothes wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👷 Mr. Li did not expect that even if he made a patent for it, he still could not stop the rampant problem of copycats. Besides hand-wringing, he chose to improve his product continuously. It took him ten years to successfully transform the long umbrella, which is hard to put in the car, into a short and instantly reversible version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤔 They asked: How can we introduce the new inverse umbrella into the market without being affected by copycats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📣 As to that, I suggested that they adopt crowdfunding to tell their own stories. That would not only establish their brand name before the launch of the product and avoid copycats, but also let investors understand the work schedule, and even provide all manner of advice, so that more people could identify with the concept of the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💯 After a year of preparation, Yexin officially launched a special campaign in April this year, targeting the raising of NT$150,000 in two months, which was accomplished within ten minutes. In the next two months, the company received a hundred times more funding than the original target, reaching nearly NT$20,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌎 “We must push the brands of Taiwan to all over the world,” Ms. Li told me during her third visit. They were greatly encouraged by the success of the fund-raising and made a firm decision for the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👪 Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again. I look forward to seeing more inventors in the future go global and bloom all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/32b9bd92946de460e0000084630bbda0f7d91a59.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mazu protecting you at home</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mazu protecting you at home" /><published>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/">&lt;p&gt;🏆 July 27th was the final selection day for the second Presidential Hackathon. Congratulations to “Rounding Team,” “Angels of the Aged,” “Judicial Yuan,” “Loan Alert” and “Gov Data Opener,” the five selected outstanding teams that were commended by President Tsai Ing-wen in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👸 As the first outstanding team to win the award, the core proposition of “Rounding Team” was “Mazu protecting you at home: Providing individuals and families who choose to stay at home for end-of-life care with a targeted end-of-life care knowledge platform that is easy to learn from, easy to locate, and offers care that reaches its target,” proposed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Collaboration partners include: Hyweb Technology, Corporate Synergy Development Center, National Yang-Ming University, and Liu Yen-ling Home-based Care Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏥 Based on verification with domestic and foreign literature, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have needs based on “two do’s and three don’ts”: to be independent, to be at home, not to suffer, not to prolong life in futility, and not to burden one’s family. However, in reality, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have passed away in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚑 Taking cancer, ranking top among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan, as an example, close to 50,000 people die of cancer every year, among whom 80% were in hospitals. Why is this? “Rounding Team” believes that there are currently three problems in home-based care that need to be resolved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😯 First, the patient and their family members are “uninformed” what changes may occur and what preparations need to be made;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😵 Second, people feel “uneasy” about the quality of home-based care and whether resources available in the neighborhood and community are adequate;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🤔 Third, “unexpected” symptoms may develop, resulting in being ill-prepared in responding to emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 In spite of the mounting problems, the team nonetheless successfully demonstrated the possibility for change. Put simply, through data integration and technology application, “Rounding Team” is transforming the exemplary experiences of end-of-life care in Taiwan that rank among the top in the world into a “smart mobile care support platform” that patients and their family members can use at home through mobile phones or computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖧 For patients, they can gain an understanding of developments in their condition in advance and learn the skills of self-care they need to prepare, such as steps to alleviate pain. For family members, they can gain access to diverse sources of information and obtain support services through a single channel. Also, family members who live away from the patients can also gain up-to-date information on the physical changes in the patient through real-time data and image updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 Of course, the essence of end-of-life care ultimately lies in the people. However powerful the functions of medical knowledge platforms, they cannot operate if they are detached from mutual trust between care providers and patients, or face resistance from the patient or their family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡Thus, on top of continuing to develop the smart care platforms and specialist artificial intelligence systems proposed by “Rounding Team,” the Ministry of Health and Welfare has also promised to strengthen social dialogue, popularize care knowledge, and achieve the goal of “fully preparing for peaceful end-of-life care and zero gaps in home-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;

Based on statistics from the National Police Agency, in the last five years, there were more than 50,000 cases of “prosecution due to drink driving” in a year on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚔 Drink driving is one of the social issues that many people are concerned about. Recently, the government has amended regulations and increased penalties because of this. However, whenever the outcome of a court decision for a major drink driving case is released, doubts continue to be raised among public opinion: why “only a light penalty”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💁 This thorny issue has seen new breakthroughs recently. During the Presidential Hackathon this year, the Judicial Yuan team comprising legal and data experts proposed two ideas of “real-time reference” and the “sentencing reference aid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔧 In the last two years, the Judician Yuan has successively developed several tools, the “dictionary of difficult terms” and “dictionary of sentencing terms” to allow the public to look up professional legal terms and search for court verdicts through the “court verdict query system.” However, it is not possible to cross-reference using these tools, which instead led to difficulties for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 The Judicial Yuan team was inspired by the design of the Wikipedia interface and connected these tools to develop the “real-time reference” browser plug-in. When looking up court verdicts in the future, all you need to do is hover the mouse cursor over the term to see the corresponding explanation, allowing people who may be interested to quickly understand the contents of the court verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖥  The “sentencing information aid,” on the other hand, applies machine learning. Taking the “Offense of Unsafe to Drive” caused by drink driving as an example, they would first locate about 50,000 related court verdicts from the existing court verdict database, sort the factors involved in these offenses, and set up these factors on the sentencing information system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Anyone who is curious about the verdict only has to input different factors such as “breath alcohol content” or “vehicle type” to not only find the scope of proposed penalties, but also see the verdicts of similar cases. This way, everyone will be able to see that the same offense may result in very different sentencing outcomes, even if they only differ in one of the factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖ The Judicial Yuan team was eventually selected as one of the five outstanding teams of the Presidential Hackathon. Through them, we have seen not only the immense potential of “machine learning,” but also the innovative power brought about by “joint learning.” We look forward to future achievements of the team in resolving more doubts raised in society and putting into practice the cause of “judicial reforms that give people a sense of change” so emphasized by President Tsai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙏 Lastly, I am especially grateful to our colleagues from the Board of Science and Technology, National Development Council, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Institute for Information Industry for their assistance. It is thanks to their hard work over the last few months that the Presidential Hackathon was completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

The collaborative meeting was held on July 19th. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.gov.tw/idea/detail/348212d3-179e-4789-9e1e-ff2bcf4c00c8&quot;&gt;public response&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be made on the website after being jointly confirmed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤔 What can be shared in advance is the following: in the preparation process for the collaborative meeting, by interviewing stakeholders and analyzing statistical data, my office (Executive Yuan Public Digital Innovation Space, PDIS) found that to explore the feasibility of “vacancy tax”, there are at least three questions below that must be clarified first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚡ Firstly, there is no obvious direct correlation between the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” ratio in each city and county and the housing prices. “Low utilization (electricity usage) residence” statistics are derived by comparing and filtering the taxation data and Taipower electricity usage data each year, as done by the Ministry of the Interior’s Construction Department. According to the latest statistics, in November and December 2017, there were nearly 865,000 “low utilization (electricity usage” residences” in the country, or 10.12% of houses in the country. In 2009, this ratio was 11.49%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔎 To match the same time period, PDIS obtained the “housing affordability index” statistics from the Ministry of the Interior for the fourth quarter of 2017. We found that for the quarter, the six cities or counties with the highest “housing price to income ratio” are Taipei City (14.99 times), New Taipei City (12.71 times), Taichung City (9.61 times), Changhua County (8.79 times), Hsinchu County (8.62 times), and Kaohsiung City (8.22 times). Over the same period, the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” ratio for these six cities and counties are 6.73%, 7.65%, 9.66%, 11.78%, 11.13%, and 10.53%, respectively. This indicates that any correlation between “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” and housing prices is yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏚 Secondly, there are many causes for “low utilization (electricity usage) residences.” It is difficult to generalize. From the point of view of regional statistics, it may be that the population is moving out, or it may be the accumulation of unsold surplus houses. Furthermore, in addition to being own by investors and not yet rented or sold, a house may also be under-utilized due to other factors such as its remote location, a complication in its right of ownership, or its owner’s unwillingness to manage. In short, the multi-dimensional nature behind the phenomenon of “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚰 Thirdly, PDIS and the organizers chose to use the “low utilization (electricity usage) residence” statistics as the basis of this collaborative meeting. However, after the discussion on the same day, we also found that by incorporating water usage data and field survey, we can provide the local governments a more accurate view of the quantity, type, and distribution of “vacant houses” in their respective jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📂 Proposals at join.gov.tw website often involve social phenomena at multiple levels. Through this collaborative meeting, we hope to clarify the factual contexts to the best of our ability, so that future discussions can be more focused and traceable. We welcome the ongoing attention from everyone to the follow-up response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">By incorporating water usage data and field survey, we can provide the local governments a more accurate view.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a4cb7e739176432bcdfe8c07b3f8a71907cb5bf4.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Beyond Flatland: Machine learning and the end of the two-party binary</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B5%B0%E5%87%BA%E5%B9%B3%E9%9D%A2%E5%9C%8B-%E6%A9%9F%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E5%92%8C%E4%BA%8C%E5%85%83%E9%BB%A8%E6%B4%BE%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beyond Flatland: Machine learning and the end of the two-party binary" /><published>2019-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B5%B0%E5%87%BA%E5%B9%B3%E9%9D%A2%E5%9C%8B:%E6%A9%9F%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E5%92%8C%E4%BA%8C%E5%85%83%E9%BB%A8%E6%B4%BE%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%B5%B0%E5%87%BA%E5%B9%B3%E9%9D%A2%E5%9C%8B-%E6%A9%9F%E5%99%A8%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E5%92%8C%E4%BA%8C%E5%85%83%E9%BB%A8%E6%B4%BE%E7%9A%84%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90/">&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In democracies worldwide, billions of citizens hold an untold number of interests, opinions and positions. Political reality on the ground is vastly more complex than our political symbols and categories allow us to express. Our political choices are artificially constrained by existing abstractions that either compress us into just two large opposing parties, or in the case of proportional representation systems, a mix of smaller parties. Either way, the real complexity of people’s opinions is squashed. There are thousands of overlapping interest groups, not just two tribes. There are hundreds of thousands of issues and sub issues, not the small handful the media focus on during election cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elections and referendums severely constrain the information populations are able to send to governing bodies. Our current methods of compressing the will of the masses into party platforms, for example, leave out the 42% of Americans who now identify as independents, and whose voices are excluded from the policy formation process at every step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/euflbdw5d0uafxwbcx14dg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Gallup party identification independents&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/poll/245801/americans-continue-embrace-political-independence.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are about the same in the United Kingdom. This is especially true after Brexit. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/new-centrist-party-politically-homeless-brexit-labour-conservative-poll-a8312991.html&quot;&gt;According to the Independent&lt;/a&gt; “Millions of voters feel politically homeless and would consider backing a new centre-ground party … almost half of those questioned … said both that they did not feel represented by any established party and that a new organisation would have a chance of winning their vote.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1000-width/images/2019/06/articles/main/20190615_woc221_0.png&quot;&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a democratic population, what we ‘see’ is heavily influenced by what our representations allow us to see. Political parties are like a very low resolution photograph, obscuring critical aspects of what voters might actually want or what they would be willing to accept. Making things worse, party platforms cast off consensus issues in favor of wedge issues useful for gaining power. The Brexit referendum, alternatively, wrapped up thousands of issues into a binary vote and created a new lens — “Leave” or “Remain” — through which to see the polity. The scourge of polarization and deadlock in modern politics is a function of our mechanisms for simplifying citizen input like these, not a feature of our constitutions, governmental structures, or our populations. We live in a political flatland because our categories and our tools for thinking about ourselves and others are one dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might it offer us to make meaning of our political spaces — of ourselves as a body of citizens — as a whole, in more dimensions and in higher resolution? To answer this question, we’ll need to look to alternative methods of citizen participation, ways that move past resolving every issue by relying on a handful of critical votes like the vote for President or referendums like Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Office of Presidential Correspondence under President Obama’s Administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/magazine/what-americans-wrote-to-obama.html&quot;&gt;gave us a glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of a data source and process. During Obama’s tenure, the White House received roughly 10,000 letters per day from ordinary people. They were read by a rotating group of 300 volunteers and a handful of dedicated staff, who selected 10 letters for the President to read each day. The 10 letters were chosen as the best compromise — broadly representative of the population’s thoughts and feelings while accepting that he couldn’t possibly read and digest the full spectrum of what was pouring in. They were the result of a kind of compression algorithm run by a particularly empathic, qualitatively oriented human computer, fed a raw input of the population’s agenda in its own words. This was a process deeply rooted in respect for the human voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practice is not common, however. Recently, I spoke with an individual on the staff of one of the major departments in the US federal bureaucracy. The department was facing a public comment period in which they were expecting nearly one million comments. There was a single Federal employee tasked with reviewing the million plain-text comments. The same policy process would also see input from focused industry lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we now live in an age of mass participation, where everyone has a multitude of ways of expressing their voice, our formal government structures haven’t caught up. Today’s democracies are still shortchanging their opportunities to enhance issue-based democratic policy making. As a result, there is enormous pressure to discuss every issue during an election season — a process that predictably leaves citizens feeling unsatisfied and the government without a discernible mandate. We need a scalable compression mechanism for making better meaning of the rich, qualitative data citizens can provide. Could we automate, scale and improve on the process that happened in Obama’s letter room?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the problems of democratic governance need special consideration, processing this scale of input is not a new problem to industry. Netflix, for instance, drives production decisions by using automated data collection and analysis: the company looks at the behavior of its expansive TV- and movie-watching population and use that data to suggest other shows to viewers, as well as to inform decisions about what new shows to produce. The results of their analysis have overturned conventional thinking about who would want what, as Janko Roettgers &lt;a href=&quot;https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/netflix-lab-day-behind-the-scenes-1202011105/&quot;&gt;wrote in Variety&lt;/a&gt; in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Netflix used to recommend content based on the region that its users were in, following the general school of thinking that subscribers in South America probably would prefer different fare than subscribers in Canada. But upon looking closer at the data, the company realized that this wasn’t actually true,” Netflix VP of Product Todd Yellin said. “We find that to be greater and greater nonsense, and we are disproving it every day.”Instead, Netflix is now dividing up its subscriber base into 1,300 taste communities, which are solely based on past viewing behavior. Each and every user can belong to multiple such communities, and all of these communities spread across the globe. Sure, Yellin admitted, German comedians may be more popular in Germany, but there’s also plenty of users in the U.S. who turn into their shows. “A big part of personalization is finding taste communities globally,” Yellin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this data analysis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/&quot;&gt;are categories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/how-netflix-swallowed-tv-industry.html&quot;&gt;far more niche&lt;/a&gt; than the one dimensional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/files/201/201-h/201-h.htm&quot;&gt;flatland&lt;/a&gt; of ‘Comedy’ and ‘Drama.’ In fact, Netflix breaks movies into 76,000 categories like “Scary Cult Movies from the 1980s,” “Brain Food Docs,” and “Fight-the-System TV Shows.” Movies can belong to multiple categories, just like viewers can belong to multiple taste communities. For Netflix, the goals are clear: better recommendations and more views mean higher customer engagement, and thus retention. The more valuable the platform is, the more likely people are to recommend it and new customers are to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, along with a substantial profit motive, has rendered the most accurate portrait of the global movie and TV watching public ever created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Netflix (and the rest of us) can look more accurately at the signals created by large populations, we’re all seeing more details, and finer grain categories that describe us. Netflix can ‘see’ a lot more of the preferences of their community, because they have rendered a more detailed portrait of the complex preference space than Blockbuster ever did. If Netflix presupposed there were only a handful of categories — comedy, drama, horror, war, sports — that would define the resolution it would see its users. It would also influence the resolution at which its users would see themselves, and the language they would have to describe themselves. Imagine if we had the same fine-grained, real-time awareness of the complexity of public opinion across all issues, even issues the government isn’t aware of or ready to consider yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are better ways to represent citizens using machine learning, and these representations can be meaningful in the policy process and lead to better policy outcomes. Driven by the communication challenges inherent in protest movements like Occupy and the Arab Spring, this problem led our software team to create the open source data science platform Polis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polis &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/crowdsourcing-democracy-using-wikisurveys/&quot;&gt;offers a rough ethnography&lt;/a&gt; of a population, showing areas of consensus and disagreement across an immense spectrum of possibilities. The math inside it is roughly the same as the recommender engines Spotify or Netflix are using – it’s looking for similarities and differences among people, as well as global consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2016, I was in Turin, Italy, speaking at the Scuola di Tecnologie Civiche (School of Civic Tech) conference. Italy was focused at the time on the upcoming constitutional referendum, which was to decide the fate of the powers of the Italian executive branch, as well as Renzi’s presidency. Announcing the referendum, Renzi threatened to resign if he lost his bid to centralize powers (he lost, and did resign).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the behest of the organizers, I ran a mock deliberation on the referendum in an intimate setting of forty attendees. Opinions regarding the referendum were submitted by participants, who agreed and disagreed on statements submitted by other attendees. As participants took positions on the statements submitted by their peers, Polis’ machine learning algorithms ran automatically on the resulting opinion matrix. Think: a spreadsheet where the columns are statements instead of movies, and the rows are voters rather than movie watchers, and each cell is an agree or disagree rather than a rating. The algorithms surfaced patterns of opinion amongst participants across all statements, and formed clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some obvious opinion clusters emerged – those in favor of Renzi and centralization and those opposed. But a simple, piercing statement by one participant garnered unanimous support: “Referendums shouldn’t be used as an election surrogate.” Regardless of where they stood or their level of expertise, participants agreed that Renzi had invalidated the referendum by threatening to resign if his side lost – thus ensuring the opposition of political rivals regardless of their stance on the constitution. Meanwhile, across other statements, it was clear that a number of Renzi opponents were open to changing the constitution. What was an absolutely polarized issue  when viewed through the lens of a binary vote on a referendum, was in fact a public with complex and nuanced views, willing to consider various propositions and tradeoffs, and eager to challenge the processes by which they were being represented. Running engagements around the world, we’ve seen that same pattern play out again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of mid 2019, Polis has been used by multiple national governments, in one high profile case, it served as an input to facilitate rulemaking in the process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b&quot;&gt;regulating Uber&lt;/a&gt; in Taiwan. It’s proven able to overcome long standing deadlocks on complex issues with highly polarized stakeholders by visualizing common ground, as in Taiwan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611816/the-simple-but-ingenious-system-taiwan-uses-to-crowdsource-its-laws/&quot;&gt;debate on online alcohol sales&lt;/a&gt;. Canada’s federal government has now run multiple engagements, one of which involved the future of Canada’s visual arts marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polis was recently run in Germany with over &lt;a href=&quot;https://aufstehen.de/pol-is/&quot;&gt;30,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, who produced nearly two million votes on hundreds of crowd submitted statements. Columbia University ran a pilot in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with thousands of Americans participating (roughly 2% of the population of the city) who live in a purple district. This was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civic-assembly.org/bowling-green-report/&quot;&gt;written up as a report&lt;/a&gt; as well as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/12/political-polarization-bowling-green-study-kentucky-immigration.html&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, and covered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://civichall.org/civicist/testing-tech-consensus-purple-town/&quot;&gt;Civicist&lt;/a&gt;. New Zealand’s Department of Conservation is running public engagements with partners in independent media, and Singapore’s Ministry of Culture is talking to thousands of youth at a time. New York City’s Department of Homeless Services is running conversations related to homelessness with frontline staff, who are all able to testify to their experiences in their own words, which can be validated by their colleagues and peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no barrier to scaling the method up to the entire voting-age population of a democracy by strategically sampling, say, 10,000-20,000 people at a time, or even creating ‘always on’ citizen assemblies of that scale or much larger. The challenge now is integrating new computational methodologies with stubborn, legacy policy making processes. We also have a collective choice, whether these models of the public are to be defined by open data and reproducible, open methods, or proprietary and unable to be audited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every decision in a representative democracy will involve the public. But when the government does go to the public, seeking legitimacy and wisdom about the population’s lived experiences and preferences, democratic institutions can do better. The government can engage the public on issues and sub issues. It can engage people in rich and dynamic ways that let them know their voices are heard. It can engage the population early — when there are more problems to solve than pages of legalese written — and involve them in agenda setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New capabilities for reconciling complexity at scale in democratic populations mean new assumptions regarding the representation of populations. Future democratic systems must be much more effective at managing and integrating qualitative signals from the population at scale to avoid polarized deadlock. Systems of representative government were intentionally designed to break the back of faction. Crippled by faction, we as democratic populations should honor that tradition, and keep designing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Colin Megill</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Crippled by faction, we as democratic populations should honor that tradition, and keep designing.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a51ab24bd076a61d3d1b07f4ffda418bf88dc724.jpeg" /></entry></feed>
