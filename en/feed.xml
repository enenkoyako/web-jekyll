He introduced me to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ According to UN estimates, more than 130 million people from 42 countries worldwide are in need of humanitarian assistance this year. The cost is conservatively estimated to be US$21.9 billion. As of June this year, more than 70.80 million people have been displaced worldwide, an unprecedented historical high. In the presence of a huge and complex humanitarian crisis, a major challenge for all of us lies in how to provide immediate relief in the most critical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 Therefore, the HDX team decided to use “data for humanitarian assistance” to help define common standards for information, so that colleagues who work in humanitarian assistance everywhere can use the same tools to assess different situations. For the humanitarian aid work, which region and when do you need resources? A minor inaccuracy can lead to a significant miscalculation. By having complete information, we can ensure fast and accurate decisions to meet the actual needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 Currently, HDX has published more than 10,000 data sets in 250 regions around the world, which can be shared and accessed by everyone. In addition, HDX is committed to the development of Predictive Analytics for humanitarian aids. Everyone is invited to review the past and present data of the same region so that potential problems can be understood in advance to prevent crises before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 Using the same concept, Taiwan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ci.taiwan.gov.tw/index_en.aspx&quot;&gt;Civil IoT platform&lt;/a&gt; adopts the internationally standardized SensorThings API. For water resources, air quality, or even disaster prevention information, the world’s academic researchers and hands-on workers can get more comprehensive help through these openly available data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📒 Taiwan ranks among the best in the world in terms of transparency of government information. For example, the complete historical data of the government’s electronic procurement network has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gazette2.nat.gov.tw/EG_FileManager/eguploadpub/eg025179/ch06/type2/gov51/num12/Eg.htm&quot;&gt;made public to academic researchers&lt;/a&gt; this year, though this is not the case in most countries. Therefore, in the Presidential Hackathon in July this year, we collaborated with the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP). Many participating teams from various countries were inspired by the experiences of Taiwan for more good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/28/build-better-build-right-a-new-tool-for-sustainable-climate-resilient-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;CoST&lt;/a&gt; team led by Minister of Transparency of Honduras is actively using procurement materials to make environmental impact assessments more transparent and to resolve conflicts in economic development and public land use. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open-contracting.org/2019/08/23/cartelogy-a-tool-for-fair-competition-and-corruption-free-public-procurement-in-malaysia/&quot;&gt;Mentadak&lt;/a&gt; team from Malaysia also uses open procurement data standards to identify conflicts of interest in the procurement process. This reduces the possibility of fraud and helps good manufacturers participate in public construction. Both teams won the hackathon at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The success of Taiwan’s experience does not lie in the amount of information, but in the core spirit of social innovation - “all for one and one for all”. Through Data Collaboratives, we are contributing along with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">The complete historical data of Taiwan government’s electronic procurement network has been made public to academic researchers this year, though this is not the case in most countries.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6702fb68a013249c4482b34d60792fdebc43b342.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Civil servants can also serve as “pro bono directorates” for international nonprofit organizations</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Civil servants can also serve as “pro bono directorates” for international nonprofit organizations" /><published>2019-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB%E3%80%8C%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B%E3%80%8D</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%85%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%93%A1%E4%B9%9F%E8%83%BD%E6%93%94%E4%BB%BB-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B%E9%9D%9E%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E7%B5%84%E7%B9%94%E7%84%A1%E7%B5%A6%E8%81%B7%E7%90%86%E4%BA%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗳️ At the end of the National Day holiday, I was in Osaka, Japan, attending Devcon, a conference initiated to improve community governance and research new features. Vitalik Buterin, who is a member on the RadicalxChange Foundation Council, and also the founder of Ethereum shared with us his experience with “Quadratic Voting” in the Presidential Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Some readers may have never heard of Ethereum or Vitalik. But that doesn’t matter — the focus of this article is to share my legal basis for serving on two nonprofit organizations , as something every civil servant can reference: RadicalxChange in the United States, and the Digital Future Society in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ First, according to Article 14(1), Article 14-2(1), and Article 14-3 of the Civil Service Act, a civil servant, stipulated by the law, may not concurrently hold a public employment or business; in the case of adjunct businesses or positions for nonprofit organizations, whether or not they are paid, permission should be requested from the service agency. In my case, it is necessary to obtain consent from the Premier of the Executive Yuan beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌐 As stipulated under Article 3 of the “Regulation Permitting the Paid Employment of Civil Servants in Non-Profit Businesses or Groups”, the nominated non-profit organizations must be “legally registered or filed and established with the authorizing department”. The problem is that when it comes to an “international” non-profit organization, the organization may not necessarily be registered or established in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Logically, the reasoning that “something is impermissible just because it is neither stipulated by nor has precedence under the law” is inconsistent with the government’s ethos of encouraging the innovative spirit of civil servants. For this reason, I have consulted my colleagues who specialize in the relevant law and submitted a confirmation request to the Ministry of Civil Service. The Ministry then indicated that there is no restriction that a non-profit organization must be registered in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🆗 As stipulated by Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the regulation, if the part-time job has a negative impact on their work, damages the image of the government or civil servant, has the potential for malpractice, or is incompatible with their duty, the organization shall not grant the permission. It is worth noting that although only the “paid” part is specified here, I still consider these two “unpaid” positions with the same criteria, confirming that not only do they not have the above concerns, but also help connect my domestic work with international orgnizations with the approval of the Premier. Moreover, I use my time outside of work to perform these two “unpaid” positions and give priority strictly to the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚀 In summary, considering these two “unpaid” positions, which are directly related to social innovation and open government, and with the consent from the Premier, I will continue to participate in RadicalxChange and the Digital Future Society as a member of the board. Along with the activities to increase the opportunity to promote our innovations in related fields globally, I also hope that this experience can be used as a case for Taiwan’s civil servants to invoke and refer to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">These two “unpaid” positions are directly related to social innovation and open government.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f50428cabfed29d9ff4add66e64ef83e8e167b41.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Strong Democracy Is a Digital Democracy" /><published>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%A0%85%E5%BC%B7%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E5%9C%8B/">&lt;p&gt;🗺 Democracy improves as more people participate. And digital technology remains one of the best ways to improve participation — as long as the focus is on finding common ground and creating consensus, not division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎨 These are lessons Taiwan has taken to heart in recent years, with the government and the tech community partnering to create online platforms and other digital initiatives that allow everyday citizens to propose and express their opinion on policy reforms. Today, Taiwan is crowdsourcing democracy to create a more responsive government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌻 Fittingly, this movement, which today aims to increase government transparency, was born in a moment of national outrage over a lack of openness and accountability in politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 On March 18, 2014, hundreds of young activists, most of them college students, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-legislature/taiwan-students-occupy-legislature-over-china-trade-deal-idUSBREA2I04S20140319&quot;&gt;occupied Taiwan’s legislature&lt;/a&gt; to express their profound opposition to a new trade pact with Beijing then under consideration, as well as the secretive manner in which it was being pushed through Parliament by the Kuomintang, the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔍 Catalyzing what came to be known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/02/activist-legacy-of-taiwan-s-sunflower-movement-pub-76966&quot;&gt;Sunflower Movement&lt;/a&gt;, the protesters demanded that the pact be scraped and that the government institute a more transparent ratification process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚧 The occupation, which drew widespread public support, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/students-prepare-to-end-occupation-of-taiwans-legislature/?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;region=Footer&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised greater legislative oversight of the trade pact. (To this day, the pact has yet to be approved by Taiwan’s legislature.) A poll released after the occupation, however, showed that 76 percent of the nation remained dissatisfied with the Kuomintang government, illustrating the crisis of trust caused by the trade deal dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔗 To heal this rift and communicate better with everyday citizens, the administration reached out to a group of civic-minded hackers and coders, known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://g0v.asia/&quot;&gt;g0v&lt;/a&gt; (pronounced “gov-zero”), who had been seeking to improve government transparency through the creation of open-source tools. The organization had come to the attention of the government during the Sunflower occupation, when g0v hackers had worked closely with the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔢 In December 2014, Jaclyn Tsai, a government minister focused on digital technology, attended a g0v-sponsored hackathon and proposed the establishment of a neutral platform where various online communities could exchange policy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 Several contributors from g0v responded by partnering with the government to start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vtaiwan.tw&quot;&gt;vTaiwan&lt;/a&gt; platform in 2015. VTaiwan (which stands for “virtual Taiwan”) brings together representatives from the public, private and social sectors to debate policy solutions to problems primarily related to the digital economy. Since it began, vTaiwan has tackled 30 issues, relying on a mix of online debate and face-to-face discussions with stakeholders. Though the government is not obligated to follow vTaiwan’s recommendations (a policy that may soon change), the group’s work often leads to concrete action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 VTaiwan partly relies on a unique digital tool known as Pol.is to ensure its crowdsourced policy debates remain civil and reach consensus. Using Pol.is, any vTaiwan participant can post a comment about the topic or policy being discussed. Crucially, other users cannot directly reply to these statements, which reduces the likelihood of trolling and abuse. Instead, they can click “agree,” “disagree” or “pass/unsure” on each comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 Using real-time machine learning, Pol.is analyzes all the votes on the comments to produce an interactive map that groups like-minded participants together in relation to other, differently minded users. The map lays bare the gaps between various groups — as well as any areas of agreement. Ideally, this incentivizes people to post comments that attract more supporters, creating a path toward consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 VTaiwan has been used to solve a number of particularly thorny digital policy problems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pol.is/uber-responds-to-vtaiwans-coherent-blended-volition-3e9b75102b9b&quot;&gt;In 2015&lt;/a&gt;, it helped break an impasse over how best to regulate Uber, which had arrived in Taiwan two years earlier prompting opposition from taxi drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 In 2016, hundreds of ordinary citizens using the platform managed within a few weeks to come up with new regulations for online liquor sales, after multiyear discussions among business and social groups had broken down. And in 2018, vTaiwan helped to create new regulations for the platform economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔄 Taiwan also relies on another civic engagement platform called Join, this one maintained entirely by the government. Though similar to vTaiwan in that it uses Pol.is to create consensus, Join tackles matters beyond the digital economy, such as vacancy taxes and drug prescriptions for animals. Compared to the hundreds of thousands who have debated issues on vTaiwan, Join’s website has hosted 10.6 million unique visitors — almost half of Taiwan’s population — since it began in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Together, vTaiwan and Join are opening up more direct lines of communication between Taiwan’s government and its citizens, producing tremendous benefits for the former. Officials are exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking, while identifying core public service demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏆 The &lt;a href=&quot;https://presidential-hackathon.taiwan.gov.tw/en/&quot;&gt;Presidential Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; is yet another tech initiative bringing Taiwan’s public, private and social sectors together to solve urgent problems. At the event, the first of which was held last year, teams of hackers — composed of either private citizens or government workers — compete to design the most innovative improvements to the nation’s public services. Instead of prize money, the best teams receive a promise from the government that it will apply their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖ One of the top teams in this year’s hackathon included officials from the Judicial Yuan, the judicial branch of the Taiwanese government. The team developed two digital tools to make the nation’s judicial system more legible and transparent for everyday Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚔 Drunken driving is an issue of broad public concern in Taiwan. And in recent years, the differing sentences handed out to drivers involved in high-profile accidents have led to public confusion about why some punishments can be so light compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔧 One of the digital tools developed by the Judicial Yuan team addresses this confusion by giving the public a better sense of why punishments can differ for the same crime. Any user can simply enter in the relevant data for a hypothetical drunken-driving offense, such as blood alcohol concentration and the type of vehicle involved. The application then lists the appropriate penalties for the case, while also showing sentences from real-world drunken-driving cases that are similar to the one described. (The team analyzed over 50,000 verdicts from previous drunken-driving offenses to create the tool.) In this way, users get a better understanding of how slight changes in, for example, blood alcohol concentration can lead to radically different penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 In the closing speech of this year’s Presidential Hackathon, President Tsai Ing-wen encouraged government officials to embrace a hacker spirit as they work to meet the public’s needs. “Do it bravely; dare to make mistakes,” she said. In Taiwan, digital technology is boosting civic dialogue and infusing government with the spirit of social innovation. By giving everyone a voice, Taiwan is strengthening its democracy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In Taiwan, online platforms powered by artificial intelligence are giving citizens a chance to have their say — while keeping the trolls at bay.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd32d0cabad24eee28e50b57c48e6df591c5597d.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2020 Asia Pacific Social Enterprise Summit in Taoyuan" /><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/2020-%E4%BA%9E%E5%A4%AA%E7%A4%BE%E4%BC%81%E9%AB%98%E5%B3%B0%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%A8%E6%A1%83%E5%9C%92/">&lt;p&gt;🆕 I would like to share with you the good news: The 3rd Asia-Pacific Social Enterprise Summit will be held in Taoyuan in early May 2020. The organizer is Impact Hub Taipei, with authorization by the SME Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 The last two summits were held in Taichung and Kaohsiung respectively. Not only did they attract thousands of highly enthusiastic and experienced people from all over the world, but also through the continuous hosting of the summit, the summits gave participants from other countries the opportunity to learn about contributions from Taiwan. At the same time, the summits gave the domestic population with the same ambitions and hope to have a platform for communications and discussions, so as to solve specific social issues and to promote sustainable development through innovative business models and business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 Of course, the most important aspect of hosting an international event is the local connections. In late September, MOEA colleagues and I, accompanying the organizers of the summit, met with Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan to seek administrative support from the city government. In addition to the promise of the Mayor Cheng regarding the support of the projects related to the venue of the summit, transportation connection, and enterprise connection, Mayor Cheng very efficiently formed an inter-departmental coordination group. He also introduced in detail the government’s assistance to the social enterprises, and suggested that the organizers could include more local elements of Taoyuan in the peripheral activities of the summit such as “social enterprise tours” and “social enterprise market.” It is worth expecting these elements in next year’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌏 Moreover, in order to promote the 17 sustainable development goals and implement the overall policy objectives of “friendly and kind, suitable to live and work,” Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the sustainable development goals in the region with actual data and cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📈 In fact, according to the statistics indicators of the counties and cities of the Ministry of the Interior in 2018, the total birth rate of Taoyuan City is not only the highest in the six municipalities, but also one of the highest in the country, second only to the Lianjiang County. In addition, Taoyuan is the city with the highest net migration rate in Taiwan and the highest rate of social increase. These figures not only represent the achievements of Taoyuan in recent years, but also the foundation for promoting social innovation in the future. We look forward to Taoyuan’s contributions as a demonstration for all counties and cities in Taiwan, so we can flourish together toward the goals of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>唐鳳、黃子維</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="社會創新" /><summary type="html">Mayor Cheng also revealed that the city is planning on a “Voluntary Local Review,” hoping to become the 12th local government in the world to verify and track the effectiveness of the SDGs.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d121856e14443e4de5b39978ed77d84c5b8dc0b0.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Safeguarding Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Safeguarding Taiwan" /><published>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E8%A8%B1%E4%B8%80%E5%80%8B%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;🛡️ Taiwan is home to more than 23 million people. One point on which all agree is the importance of safeguarding national security. In the past, related policymaking was the exclusive domain of the government. Today, the people can help shape this critically important process by participating in the on-going &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 The Digital Dialogues are part of the AIT@40 campaign launched by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Digital Innovation Space in an effort to help digitally democratize the U.S.-Taiwan relationship.  They are, according to AIT, “the first of its kind anywhere in the world  – a public forum to discuss the results of an artificial intelligence-enabled digital dialogue between a foreign mission and a local community on how to tackle a pressing foreign policy challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍀 They comprise four online public consultations this year on Taiwan’s role in global society, April; U.S.-Taiwan economic and commercial exchanges, June; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, August; and people-to-people ties, November.  As AIT Director Brent Christensen said, “AIT is interested in what you, the public, have to say on these matters.  We hope these dialogues will provide valuable insights that AIT can put into practice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🛩️ Those interested in learning more about why Taiwan is purchasing advanced weapons like the F-16 C/D Block 70 fighters and M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as the reasons for closer U.S.-Taiwan defense cooperation, must take part in any discussions on the bilateral security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇺🇸 The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important security ally and partner. In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted by the U.S. Congress in a bipartisan vote of support. It states that the U.S. government should provide “defense materials and technical services that enable Taiwan to obtain sufficient quantities to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities.” This ensures the U.S. supports Taiwan’s policy of maintaining robust self-defense capabilities while consolidating national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✍️ Since 2008, the U.S. has sold defensive weapons worth more than US$24 billion to Taiwan—an amount underscoring the strength of two-way ties. In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ait-polis.pdis.nat.gov.tw/55drvcpvrk&quot;&gt;Digital Dialogues&lt;/a&gt; give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔜 AIT has said the AIT@40 Digital Dialogues for 2019 are not the end of the road for this revolutionary participatory policymaking initiative. They intend to continue to engage in future digital dialogues on the U.S-Taiwan relationship, including for the drafting of the Talent Circulation Alliance White Paper, which will become part of AmCham’s influential annual White Paper. Keep a close eye on this potential-laden public-private partnership for the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">In addition to analyzing and discussing this key development, the Digital Dialogues give the people a voice in this vital aspect of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/9/93f7f00652cc6dbed3c8f0e473dc2791fcb8339a.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Universities can be Social Innovation Organizations too" /><published>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E8%88%87%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E7%9A%84%E8%B7%9D%E9%9B%A2/">&lt;p&gt;🎓 “Can private universities turn into a social innovation organizations?” A few days ago, Professor Richard Fang from the Culture University asked me this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📜 Professor Fang asked this question because the Department of Commerce announced the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” in August this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Last year, the “Corporation Law” was amended to include the conditions for company establishment, and added “the company’s actions to promote public interest.” Social enterprises that take into account their social responsibility and market operations can register as a company and voluntarily expose the charter to solve the problem in the past that profit and mission are unable to balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⏳ However, in the social enterprise ecosystem, organizations with various forms also hoping that each other’s missions and  results can be more clearly disclosed in public. Therefore, when the amendment to the “Company Law” was passed, the Legislature  attached a resolution requesting the government to discuss how to respond to the needs of these friends within a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇪🇨 To this end, many friends are actively seeking methods and providing advice. In March, I met with William H. Clark, Jr., the main promoter of the Common Law Act in the United States. He shared the case of Ecuador and provided a reference for Taiwan: that is, first proposing administrative rules and experimenting for a while, then form a formal law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The advantage of “administrative rules” is that organizers who are committed to social innovation can proactively expose their charters, missions, and public interest reports without penalties. Not only to protect the current legal mechanism, but also let relevant companies refer to the results during the trial, and then decide how to form the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡 Therefore, we wrote the “Principles of Social Innovation Organization Registration” as a pilot point. Any type of organization can be registered as a social creation organization. The purpose is to enable any friend who is interested in social innovation to find a partner by log into the platform and expand social innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏫  So, can private universities turn into social innovation organizations? My answer is: “Of course!” Private colleges and universities, as long as they are registered in the organization type under the “financial corporation”, they can be regarded as a “business oriented financial corporation”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌱 Over the years, whether it is the Ministry of Education’s “U-start Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program” or the “University Social Responsibility Practice Program” (USR), the creativity and vitality demonstrated by the teachers and students have fully demonstrated the spirit of social innovation: “everyone’s business, everyone helps.” As a organizer, colleges and universities will also develop closer partnerships for the practice of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 The registration for the Cultural University has just completed. I hope that in the future, both public and private higher education institutions will be able to log in together on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://si.taiwan.gov.tw&quot;&gt;si.taiwan.gov.tw&lt;/a&gt; platform and become fellow organizations to empower social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, the development of Taiwan in the past several hundred years has left a lot of humanistic scenery in the mountains and forests. Under the multiplication of the advantages of climate, geography, and people, the mountains and forests of Taiwan have rich background and resources in all fields, such as hiking, rock climbing, stream tracing, camping, bird watching, teaching, and so on, which are waiting for the exploration and experience of the people from the country and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🔓 Over a long period of time, due to safety control and other considerations, many mountains and forests in Taiwan have been blocked and restricted to varying degrees, which have prevented the mountain friends from access. However, under the guidance of Premier Su and the coordination of Minister Chang Ching-sen, the Executive Yuan has passed the mountain forest control measures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Agriculture Committee, and the Ministry of State Defense, hoping to drastically loosen the restrictions and provide more opportunities for people to get close to the mountains and forests on the premise of maintaining sustainable living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🍲 At the same time, the government has also moved beyond the practice of acting blindly irrespective of reality when formulating mountain and forest policies. Instead of sitting in air conditioned rooms to think about mountain affairs, we opened up “mountain climbing activities management” in the “Talk” section of the public policy participation platform (Join.gov.tw) of the National Development Council. We would like to welcome all citizens to provide advice and criticism on mountain and forest policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📢 This year’s national discussions are divided into five major themes: “Opening forests,” “Information transparency,” “Facility services,” “Mountaineering education,” and “Responsibility commitment.” The content of the discussions are open to the public, from the conception before the mountaineering, the clarification of the responsibility, to the control loosening before accessing the mountain, the redesign of the application process , and to the mountain house construction and the establishment of additional communication base stations after entering the mountain, etc. It can be said to include various aspects of mountain activities, which is worth everyone’s wisdom together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 In just a few seconds, you can choose “yes” or “no” to express your position to others’ opinions on the mountain and forest policy. You are also welcome to further share your innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💞 After September 30, the relevant departments and councils will review all the messages one by one according to the scope of their responsibilities, and discuss how to adopt the  “Group-Informed Consensus.” In this way, the messages that resonate among the masses will become part of the mountain and forest policy of Taiwan for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Executive Yuan’s monthly participation officer meeting, the motion passed the ballot to become the subject of the 53rd Collaborative Meeting. On August 16th, the collaborative meeting was convened and livestreamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤝 The meeting produced several recommendations that was agreed upon on all sides during the meeting, that the organizers, namely the Council of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, must publicly respond on the online participation platform with the specific details of the selection situation before October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the recommendations, all participating agencies had already achieved some considerable common understanding during the meeting, in regards to the clarification of the relevant legal aspects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚖️ Firstly, the agencies agreed that the «Draft Proposal for The Regulations Governing the Use and Management of Human Drugs on Dogs, Cats, and Non-economic Animals» does not contradict the «Pharmaceutical Affairs Law».&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation made that day by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine clearly stated, “The proposed Regulations were stipulated in accordance with Article Four, Paragraph Three of the «Animal Protection Law», which also include the regulations for selling and distribution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) also pointed out that: “In regards to the administrative scope of the use of human medication being used to treat animals, Paragraphs Two and Three of Article Four of the «Animal Protection Law» state that the Council of Agriculture’s administrative range already includes the distribution and selling of human medications for animal use. Therefore, regarding regulations for distribution and selling of such medications, we should prioritize the application of the «Animal Protection Law».”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💊 Second, the 597 types of pharmaceuticals that have been publicly announced which can currently be used for the treatment of animals, will not be affected by «Good Distribution Practice for Pharmaceuticals» (PIC/S GDP), ensuring their continued supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 21st, the TFDA sent an official notice to the guilds for pharmacists, pharmaceutical companies, and the pharmaceuticals marketing agents to explain that before the proposed Management Regulations come into effect, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of animal medical treatment, you can still currently obtain human medication for use in treating animals, with the assistance of veterinarians. This is in accordance with Article Two, Rule Four of the «Animal Protection Law», which sets the categories of human medications that can be used on animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📲 Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the proposer, seconder, colleagues of related departments, representatives of the pharmacists and the veterinarians guilds, and interested parties such as experts and scholars, we have specially invited the administrator of the Facebook group “CrazyCat Club” and the Forum Moderator of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/cat/&quot;&gt;/cat/ board&lt;/a&gt; on the PTT Bulletin Board System to attend and participate in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🇰🇷 Finally, the time period of the collaborative meeting just happened to coincide with Korea Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) coming to Taiwan to shoot a special report on the subject of opening up government and social innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, aside from the live Internet broadcast of the entire event, the open discussion period provided the EBS team with footage and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;✨ The producer of the EBS team said to me many times that day: “This kind of scene, it’s beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌈 I sincerely hope that aside from sending back the information gained from the meetings to their own social groups, all of the participants can bring the feelings of that day into more of the follow-up discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Zach Huang</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">Furthermore, this collaborative meeting innovated on the invitation procedure in order to reach more people.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/8/8b31e4edccedc00fbee350ae02a52ffcf96fce55.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Crowdfunding an umbrella</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Crowdfunding an umbrella" /><published>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%95%86%E5%91%A8%E5%B0%88%E6%AC%84-%E7%9C%BE%E5%BF%97%E7%BE%A4%E5%8A%9B-%E6%92%90%E8%B5%B7%E9%9B%A8%E5%82%98/">&lt;p&gt;☔ As an island on the Pacific Ocean, torrential rain is a typical characteristic of the climate in Taiwan. Therefore, umbrellas have always been indispensable for the Taiwanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🥇 Thirty years ago, constant need for umbrellas provided a golden cow for Taiwan. When the industry was most prosperous, there were more than 300 umbrella factories in Taiwan. At that time, on average, one in every 40 people in the world used an umbrella made in Taiwan, thus the region’s nickname “umbrella kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;☂️ Today, Taiwan’s umbrellas have once again become the focus of the world. In July of this year, the “inverted umbrella” invented by the Taoyuan brand “Yexin,” raised nearly NT$ 20 million within 62 days, winning the 2019 German Red Point product awards. It will officially enter the largest international fund-raising platform, Kickstarter, in October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💡 All that originated from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sayit.pdis.nat.gov.tw/2018-03-14-%E7%A4%BE%E5%89%B5%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83-%E7%AC%AC%E5%8D%81%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1-office-hour/%E6%9D%8E%E9%B3%B3%E7%8F%A0&quot;&gt;a visit in mid-March last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🙋 During my regular Wednesday office hours, Ms. Li Fengzhu, the one in charge of Yexin, walked quickly into my office in the social center. As soon as she sat down, she started to tell the company’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚉 Li Shengqun, the founder of Yexin, Ms. Li’s younger brother, is an expert in making umbrellas. When he went to Japan on a business trip more than a decade ago, he was busy looking at people coming and going at the bus station in Tokyo. They were in a great bustle, taking down their umbrellas. He was thus inspired to develop a reverse umbrella which would allow the umbrella to be folded in the opposite direction to avoid getting people’s clothes wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👷 Mr. Li did not expect that even if he made a patent for it, he still could not stop the rampant problem of copycats. Besides hand-wringing, he chose to improve his product continuously. It took him ten years to successfully transform the long umbrella, which is hard to put in the car, into a short and instantly reversible version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🤔 They asked: How can we introduce the new inverse umbrella into the market without being affected by copycats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📣 As to that, I suggested that they adopt crowdfunding to tell their own stories. That would not only establish their brand name before the launch of the product and avoid copycats, but also let investors understand the work schedule, and even provide all manner of advice, so that more people could identify with the concept of the developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💯 After a year of preparation, Yexin officially launched a special campaign in April this year, targeting the raising of NT$150,000 in two months, which was accomplished within ten minutes. In the next two months, the company received a hundred times more funding than the original target, reaching nearly NT$20,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🌎 “We must push the brands of Taiwan to all over the world,” Ms. Li told me during her third visit. They were greatly encouraged by the success of the fund-raising and made a firm decision for the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👪 Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again. I look forward to seeing more inventors in the future go global and bloom all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Through a new model of crowd collaboration, traditional industries such as Yexin now shine again.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://talk.pdis.nat.gov.tw/uploads/default/original/2X/3/32b9bd92946de460e0000084630bbda0f7d91a59.jpeg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mazu protecting you at home</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mazu protecting you at home" /><published>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%AA%BD%E7%A5%96%E6%8A%B5%E5%AE%B6-%E8%AD%B7%E4%BD%A0%E5%B9%B3%E5%AE%89/">&lt;p&gt;🏆 July 27th was the final selection day for the second Presidential Hackathon. Congratulations to “Rounding Team,” “Angels of the Aged,” “Judicial Yuan,” “Loan Alert” and “Gov Data Opener,” the five selected outstanding teams that were commended by President Tsai Ing-wen in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👸 As the first outstanding team to win the award, the core proposition of “Rounding Team” was “Mazu protecting you at home: Providing individuals and families who choose to stay at home for end-of-life care with a targeted end-of-life care knowledge platform that is easy to learn from, easy to locate, and offers care that reaches its target,” proposed by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Collaboration partners include: Hyweb Technology, Corporate Synergy Development Center, National Yang-Ming University, and Liu Yen-ling Home-based Care Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏥 Based on verification with domestic and foreign literature, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have needs based on “two do’s and three don’ts”: to be independent, to be at home, not to suffer, not to prolong life in futility, and not to burden one’s family. However, in reality, the vast majority of terminally ill patients have passed away in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚑 Taking cancer, ranking top among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan, as an example, close to 50,000 people die of cancer every year, among whom 80% were in hospitals. Why is this? “Rounding Team” believes that there are currently three problems in home-based care that need to be resolved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😯 First, the patient and their family members are “uninformed” what changes may occur and what preparations need to be made;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;😵 Second, people feel “uneasy” about the quality of home-based care and whether resources available in the neighborhood and community are adequate;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🤔 Third, “unexpected” symptoms may develop, resulting in being ill-prepared in responding to emergencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;📶 In spite of the mounting problems, the team nonetheless successfully demonstrated the possibility for change. Put simply, through data integration and technology application, “Rounding Team” is transforming the exemplary experiences of end-of-life care in Taiwan that rank among the top in the world into a “smart mobile care support platform” that patients and their family members can use at home through mobile phones or computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🖧 For patients, they can gain an understanding of developments in their condition in advance and learn the skills of self-care they need to prepare, such as steps to alleviate pain. For family members, they can gain access to diverse sources of information and obtain support services through a single channel. Also, family members who live away from the patients can also gain up-to-date information on the physical changes in the patient through real-time data and image updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🚸 Of course, the essence of end-of-life care ultimately lies in the people. However powerful the functions of medical knowledge platforms, they cannot operate if they are detached from mutual trust between care providers and patients, or face resistance from the patient or their family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🏡Thus, on top of continuing to develop the smart care platforms and specialist artificial intelligence systems proposed by “Rounding Team,” the Ministry of Health and Welfare has also promised to strengthen social dialogue, popularize care knowledge, and achieve the goal of “fully preparing for peaceful end-of-life care and zero gaps in home-based care.”&lt;/p&gt;
